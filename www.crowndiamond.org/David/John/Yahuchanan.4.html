		pedigree that they neglected posterity; and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span>they avoided matters of substance in favor of anything and 
		everything that might support their conviction that the universe must 
		give answer to their fantasies. Turning this delusion to Y’shar<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:92%;font-family:PaleoBora;mso-fareast-font-family:PaleoBora;
mso-bidi-font-family:PaleoBora">al</span>’s benefit, Ya’akov had been able to

		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">6</b> Now, 
		Ya’akov’s well was at Sh’khem, and Y’shua had grown weary because of the 
		long journey and the stress of settling back into solitude after 
		spending so much time fielding intense interactions with those who heard 
		his teachings. As noontime approached, he reached Ya’aqov’s well; and he 
		decided to sit on its casing, in order to rest, for a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">7</b> By and

		drink of her water,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">8</b> 
		Because his disciples had gone into the city to buy food, leaving him on 
		his own. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">9</b> This 
		woman of Ephrayim said to him, “How is that you, being of the Yehudim, 
		ask me for a drink, seeing I’m a woman of Shomron? The Yehudim have 
		nothing to do with the people of Shomron.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">10</b> 
		Sensing that her words could easily become sharp, he teased her, “If you 
		had known of the gift HaShem has reserved for you and who it is that 
		asks for a drink of your water, you would have asked him for a drink of
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Living</i> Water, and he would 
		have given it to you.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">11</b> 
		Intrigued, the woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing with which to 
		draw water, and the well is deep. Where might that “living water” come 
		from?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">12</b> “Are 
		you greater than our father Ya’akov, who gave us the well and who also 
		drank of its water: him and his children and, also, his cattle?” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">13</b> 
		Y’shua addressed the question hidden in his cousin’s words, saying, 
		“Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">14</b> “But any who drinks of the water that I shall give him will never 
		thirst; for the water that I give becomes a cistern of Living Waters 
		that will well up from within him, bringing everlasting Life.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">15</b> Disarmed by his gentle advances, she said, “Sir, give me this 
		water, so that I will never thirst again! I would no longer have to come 
		here every single day to draw water, either!” <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">16</b> 
		Y’shua said to her, “Go. Call your husband, and return here.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">17</b> Deflated but amused, the woman protested, “I have no husband.” 
		Y’shua reached out to her, “You have well said, that you have no 
		husband!<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">18</b> “You 
		have had <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">five</i> husbands, and 
		the one that you now have isn’t your husband,
		<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">either</i>! In this, you are 
		truthful.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">19</b> 
		Interested, the woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you’re a 
		prophet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">20</b> 
		Perhaps <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">you</i> can explain to me 
		which is correct! Our fathers worshipped here, in this mountain. There 
		were two worship centers in those days, and the sons of Ephraim could 
		choose between them as befit their needs; but the Yehudim say that in 
		Yerushaliem is the place where men ought to worship.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">21</b> 
		Y’shua answered her, “Woman, believe me! The hour is coming when you 
		shall worship the Father neither in this mountain, nor even at 
		Yerushaliem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">22</b> “You 
		don’t know what you worship, but we know what we worship; for salvation 
		is of the Yehudim. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">23</b> “But 
		the hour is coming, and now is, when true worshippers shall worship the 
		Father in spirit and in truthfulness; for the Father seeks such to 
		worship him. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">24</b> 
		“HaShem is a Spirit; and those who worship him must worship him within 
		their own, truthful spirits, and not by traveling to some particularly 
		hallowed place to perform some approved mantra or ritual.” <o:p></o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">25</b> The 
		woman artfully replied, “I have heard that the Rabbi that is the King 
		under HaMashiyach is coming: a man called the ‘messiah.’ When he comes, 
		he will tell us all things.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">26</b> 
		Yahushua said to her, “I that speak with you am he.” <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">27</b> While 
		they still talked, his disciples returned and marvelled that Y’shua 
		talked with the woman, and they wondered what it was all about; and yet 
		no man asked of her, “What is your business, here?” Nor did they press 
		Y’shua to ask him why he was talking with her. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">28</b> 
		Coming to her senses because of the new arrivals and the old disputes, 
		the woman left her waterpot on the well’s casing and made her way back 
		to the city, where she exhorted the men of Sh’khem, pleading, </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">29</b> 
		“Come! See a man who told me all I ever did! Is not he the messiah?” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">30</b> And 
		so, the people of Sh’khem set out, leaving the city to take care of 
		itself; and they cautiously made their way back to the well, wanting to 
		question Y’shua. <o:p></o:p>

		Meanwhile, Y’shua’s disciples looked after him, saying, “Master, eat.”
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">32</b> 
		Setting a hook, Y’shua said, “I have food to eat that you don’t know

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">33</b> In 
		the consternation that followed this remark, his disciples asked one

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">34</b> 
		Watching them the way a fisherman studies his bobber, Y’shua allowed

		a teaching: “My food is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish 
		his work. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">35</b> 
		“You’ve heard everyone say that there are four hard months after Pesach,

		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">36</b> “And

		that both he who has sown and all who reap can rejoice together. </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">37</b> 
		“Therein lies the truth of the saying, One man sows; another man reaps.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">38</b> “I 
		send you to reap that for which you have bestowed no labor. You have 
		entered into the labors of those who sowed. Honor the seed; for it sustains us all.” </p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">39</b> Many 
		of the people of the city of Sh’khem and the countryside of Shomron 
		believed on Y’shua because of the testimony of the woman, when she 
		confessed, “He told me all I ever did.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
