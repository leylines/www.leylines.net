		<td class="auto-style5" colspan="4">Posted in this partition is my 
		interpretation of the parable of the fig tree that was cursed by the 
		earthlty messiah on his way to Jerusalem because it had leaves, but not 
		fruit. I believe that interpretation to be correct, but some are 
		offended by it; and one very nearly accused me of being a false prophet. 
		My direct reply weas " A false prophet would have had evil figs. This 
		tree had none. Now, the scripture does speak of evil fits, and your 
		interpretation bears consideration in that context." <br />
		<br />
		That reply is a little snarky, but I let it pass, but I couldn't let the 
		accusation pass. Rather than offer tit for tat, as warring countries do, 
		I posted the following on my personal page (giving space for the waters 
		to heal):<br />
		<br />
		I had reason to think of false prophets, recently. When my mind goes 
		there, it tends to land somewhere in the Bible Belt. Now, that's pretty 
		close to an accusation, and we know the accuser of the brethren is cast 
		down. <br />
		<br />
		I'll put a foot in the ditch with that accuser, by giving an opinion. I 
		admit that I fudge the bet since I warn you it's an opinion, but warning 
		seemed appropriate.<br />
		<br />
		Earth has had some bad shakeups in the past: there are wonders just off 
		the coasts, popping up from the ground, occasionally, being stripped of 
		vegetation, etc. But the shake-up coming on this moment of history is to 
		be worse than any before or any after. We've had the nuclear meltdowns 
		in Russia and Japan, the oil geyser in the Gulf of Mexico. Fires, 
		floods, cyclones, earthquakes, wars. These are bad, but. No, let me say 
		BUT!<br />
		<br />
		In my OpinioN, New Jerusalem coming down from heaven like a bride all 
		prepared? Fulfillment of that prophecy is within each of us. BuT, I'll 
		say this about the effects of that vision: for there is both prophecy 
		and the effects of every vision.<br />
		<br />
		New Jerusalem as EFFECT (Oh! How we hedge our bets!) is Antarctica. The 
		ice is her wedding dress, It's melting, and what's underneath is coming 
		AS down from heaven. <br />
		<br />
		But for the elect's sake, those days are shortened. The elect, the 
		inheritors of Earth, will have to have a place to go while the waters 
		and the ground everywhere else on Earth are healed from the ravages of 
		the last 2024 years<br />
		Ah! The treasures of the ice and snow. Beautiful for situation: on the 
		sides of the North. Only one place on Earth is on the sides of the 
		North, and that place is the South Pole.</td>
