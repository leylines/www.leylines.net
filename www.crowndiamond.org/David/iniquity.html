		<td class="auto-style93"><br><span class="auto-style85">The name Lucifer means "Light Bearer." 
		Its negative connotations stem from tradition, and that's not a bad 
		thing; 
		because those who have yet to question their priorities are ill-equipped 
		to reach conclusions; their fous is parameters, and that is as it should 
		be. Of necessity, that focus leads to 
		outward observances because every thought of parameters is projected to 
		measure things other than themselves, or other things in terms of 
		themselves. Focused outwardly, even when looking inside, the realm of 
		essence, in which all are understood as One, is not within their 
		consideration. Becaus things and companions are perceived 
		as "other"--as strangers, once removed from any connection to themselves, so are conceptions of the godhead. 
		Though falling short, such misapprehension is 
		not without benefit.<br><br>Lucifer was a wonderful light bearer: 
		spectacular, perfect in all his ways, 
		everything unto which a man might aspire, were it not for the iniquity 
		found in him, the fatal flaw. This stain, 
		if stain it was, could not have been intrinsic to Lucifer's character; 
		for he was created as the covering cherub for all things in heaven and 
		on earth. Iniquity was unknown in him or by 
		him or of him until it was discovered, there. And when it was 
		discovered, the fall was not only immediate, but d also necessary: because of 
		the Creator's mercy and by reason of the love of HaShem <span class="auto-style86">
		hwhy</span>, in whom we also live, moving among each other, in accordance with our states 
		of being.<br><br>The 
		covering cherub of heaven, then, Lucifer was perfect until ihe was not. 
		Did he make a mistake? Did he rebel? Was he perfect only in his 
		performance while he nursed a core or wickedness apart from the sight of 
		him who called him perfect in his ways? I think not. In my view, 
		iniquity has nothing to do with behavior, with thought, or with motive, 
		aspiration, or any such thing. The iniquity found in Lucifer was not 
		his. It came from without. The question, then, was that outside source 
		wickedness, the devil's touch?<br><br>It's commonly understood that "iniquity" is "grossly 
		unfair or immoral behavior." If that's the case, then Lucifer's previous perfection was 
		a matter of his performance, rather than a predictable result 
		of his character. If that was the case, then the perfection he once 
		enjoyed in the mind of God was his to maintain 
		and his to lose, if his resolve for good should fail. And if should it fail, 
		thereby opening the cherub to regret becasuse the fault was his, iniquity would have its 
		triumphant way, wreaking 
		havoc on his soul, in every sense. If it were the result of failure, the inquity found in the Light Bearer 
		would better be righteously attributed to the corrosive effects of narcissistic 
		pride. That's a reasonable conclusion, as we are warned that "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a 
		fall." In any case, the fault found in Lucifer took root in his core being 
		and became causation. It would not have been the effect of 
		actions or reactions.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">If Lucifer's fall was due to 
		an innate wickedness or a propensity for wickedness, the question 
		arises: "What was God's intent in appointing the great angel with a 
		fatal flaw to be the 
		'covering cherub'?" That God was somehow incompetent as a creator? Or 
		that God created Lucifer for the purpose that he should, later, be mocked, when the iniquity 
		had its way? Was God a sadist when he created the heavens and Earth? <br>
		<br>We are taught that HaShem, alone, is perfect in 
		all his ways: that there is none good, but God. It''s possible that Lucifer's 
		perfection was contingent upon his rest withn 
		the perfection of the Father, and that he simply made a mistake. Indeed, 
		a meaning of "<a class="auto-style97" href="sin.html">sin</a>" is to 
		make a mistake. Well, that begs the question of whether God created the 
		universe and filled it with life of all kinds for the purpose of playing 
		with it? Lucifer and all who erred were casualties of a God whose mind 
		is dualistic: good on one hand and not good on the other. That's the 
		kind of goodness we enjoy, but God has a goodness that transcends any 
		values we now have.<br><br>Cutting to the chase, my view is that the imperfection discovered in 
		Lucifer was not duie to any failing on his part, nor any incompetence or 
		mischief attributable to the Good Creator of all things. It 
		attributable, and indeed, intrinsic to the nature of the creative 
		process, itself. The command was "Let there be: and the Light Bearer 
		stepped forth in fulfillment of that Word, taking upon himself 
		responsibility to both fulfill it and to see that the Light continued. 
		Thus, within himself, the Light-Brearer streaked forth into infinity, so 
		that the Light would be in all places and to every memory within time. 
		Bearing within himself the Logos of all that now is and all that should 
		thereafter be, Lucifer would have been remiss in his duty to Bear the 
		Light if he did not also complete the circle of time and bring it back 
		to its beginning, that there should be no shadow of darkness in the 
		Creation of HaShem, the Creator of light by the force of his Word.<br>
		<br>Consider the nature of light. It streams from its source, yes, but 
		it has mass: photons and, God knows, what else! Mass, moving through 
		time and space, is subject to the pull of the latenet force of inertia. 
		Inertia is equivalent to the force of gravity, which accompanies and 
		acts upon all mass; and the gravitational pull of inertia upon the mass 
		of light causes light to bend as it moves through space and time. This 
		bending of the light was necessary if the command was to be fulfilled: 
		"Let there be"; else, there would be pockets of not-being in eternity: 
		godless pockets, without order. In a sense, therefore, the iniquity of 
		inertia trailed Lucifer as he 
		performed his obligation, which was to do the Father's will. The 
		iniquity found in him was in no way intrinsic to his 
		character, nor did it have greater consequence than the gift of Light 
		with with Lucifer was first entrusted. One with HaShem before the 
		command, "Let there be," the Light Bearer needed to see to his duty.<br></span>
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Lucifer's fall was subsequent to the 
		creation of the heavens and Earth; for when iniquity was found in him, the judgment 
		was that he should be cast down to Earth, where he would live and die as 
		a human being. Perfect before iniquity was 
		found in him, that fault, if fault it was, would have "crept into him: unawares" 
		as he did what was required of him. By what measurement can any accuse him of error, 
		dtherefore?. He 
		served in his capacity as commanded, perfect in all his ways, until the 
		iniquity was found in him. 
		Lucifer was not God's enemy. He was perfect in all his ways.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Should any insist 
		upon fault, that fault must have root in the nature of the light Lucifer carried, 
		not in the nature of his being. Were it not so, one would have to 
		argue that God willfully chose to create a dissembling monster with whom 
		he could compete for the love of mankind; for the Breath of Life became 
		the light within Man. That's psycho-pathological. It that's the case, 
		we're not sinners in the hand of an angry god; rather, we're victims in 
		the hand of a sadistic creator. Truly, the accuser of the brethren will 
		be cast down because to accuse any is to accuse the Creator. No, was the 
		inquity found in Luicifer was attrituabl to the nature of 
		the light he carried; and because light is a created thing, we understand 
		that it serves the Father in a parable. The mystic has his indefensible views, but the 
		realist maintains that the dynamics of Light follow codes that are 
		imbedded and operative 
		within the nature of all created things. <br><br>Because of the force of 
		gravity, we understand that each of us is subject in every moment of 
		every day to the latent pull of inertia, as is the light of which we are 
		comprised. A young man considers the pull of gravity to be almost 
		negligible, but time will school him with its perserverent strength. It 
		is very strong, indeed; for without the gravitational 
		miracle of accretion, there would be no Creation; for accretion, the child 
		of intertia, provides the skeleton for all that is and the life it all supports.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85">Captive<span class="auto-style85"> within the 
		accretion of Creation, man sees two laws within himself: that of light, 
		and that of darkness; that of good, and that of evil; that of the 
		spirit, and that of the flesh; that of salvation, and that of 
		condemnation. Man sees no alternative; for there is no honest compromise 
		between the extremes to which he is suibject. He sees no possible 
		solution; but with God, all things are possible, and mankind existed in 
		the mind of God before time. The spiritual equivalent of accretion is 
		returning man to his roots in HaShem; for we shall see him face upon 
		faces, knowing as we are known. <br><br>I conclude that Lucifer's fall did not disqualify him 
		from grace; for the iniquity found in him was not of his doing, but was 
		akin to the pull inertia imposes upon Creation' matter. Neither good nor 
		bad, inertia is a latent force capable of bending light; and Lucifer's 
		imperfection was among its effects. With the command, "Let there be," 
		Lucifer was fated to tumble from the immortal realm into the mortal realm, 
		because , through Creation, he became vulnerable to the phenomenon of acretion, which is akin to incarnation. 
		Although light has a nearly negligible mass, the weight of its photons 
		renders it succeptible to the iniquity of gravity.<br><br><br><br>The 
		invisible things of God are made visible in the things that are made. being 
		the case, the conclusion is that iniquity has little to do with the tug-of-war between light 
		and darkness, good and evil. As suggested, iniquity is the spiritual equivalent of the latent 
		force of inertia. This is a reasonable conclusion; for the invisible 
		things of God are visible in the things that are made, suggesting that 
		iniquity is spiritual gravity, whose weighty pull marred Lucifer's 
		perfection. </span> <br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">Just as natural light curves as it arcs across the 
		vast dimensions of the universe because of the pull of mass, spiritual 
		light is also affected by body mass, whether the life form is human or 
		angelic. I don't believe that the fate of Lucifer was the result of sin 
		or some behavioral error, precisely; rather, I think the iniquity found in 
		him was reflective of the nature of the Light, itself: At the core of all 
		things, light is the cohesive element of the universe. Even rocks are 
		children of Light; for over eons, light became trapped in the pull of 
		matter. Rocks absorb it, vegetation drinks it down, storing it in roots, 
		that it may transform it into food to sustain animal&nbsp; life. Without 
		the phenomenon of light, there would be no measurable thing anywhere.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Beginnings 
		have endings. The loss of Lucifer's heavenly state brought radical change, but not 
		tragic change. God is good. Aware of that goodness, the angels of HaShem shouted for joy at 
		the creation of 
		man, whose physical form, comprised of stored light that is capable of 
		receiving, then reflecting or projecting, spiritual light as well.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">As time unfolded, mankind would become chariots of Ruach HaQodesh, 
		God's Holy Spirit, serving as vehicles for angelic transformation. 
		Living and dying as men, the hosts of heaven would enter upon the task 
		of establishing unique identities they could carry into life 
		everlasting, which was HaShem's intent, from the beginning. The great 
		wedding feast aproaches; and on that day, the incarnate souls who loved 
		the Light of God will become transfigured, no longer mere <em>bearers</em> 
		of Light, but as beings of Light.Working out their perfection during 
		their lives on Earth, they shall become transformed into <em>beings</em> 
		of Light through the renewal of their minds. </span> 
		<br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">
		<img class="auto-style95" height="200" src="https://www.crowndiamond.org/David/iniquity.gif" style="float: left" width="105">This 
		mystery is among 
		the things the early followers of Y'shua were unable to bear. They were 
		unprepared:&nbsp; not because of 
		failings or weaknesses, but because the demands of order follow 
		sequence. The walk in the steps of messiah is led and paced by Ruach 
		HaQodesh, which rewards he faithful with gifts of knowledge concerning 
		the nature and ways of HaShem. 
		There was war--unruliness-- in Heaven because it was of paramount 
		importance that God's sons learn and understand "this," so&nbsp; they 
		would be able to endure, conquer, and triumph over "that."</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">In times past, the apostle lamented that the mystery of iniquity was 
		alr already at work among early believers in the Way, the Truth, and the 
		Life. From the last seder of mashiyach Y'shua to the uproars of this 
		present day, stumbles among believers were apparent and remain apparent. 
		The weight of iniquity takes its toll because the lessons are difficult: 
		impossible, except through the guidance of HaShem, and that's the point: 
		the path of the cross 
		leads to knowledge of the intersection of the mortal and immortal 
		realms, teaching us of God's love as we make our way back home. Far greater than the light 
		found in natural man, the Light within spiritual man is the very 
		essence of the Godhead. Called to walk in the perfection of Father and 
		Son, mankind must carry the Treasure of God's Light, which is the very 
		Life of HaShem, in 
		earthen vessels that must have an end.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Living the life of the Spirit in mortal bodies 
		is a dynamic experience, and the mass of physical man man's body exerts 
		the 
		equivalent of the latent force of inertia within the new creature, the 
		spiritual man. This is why Paul saw two laws operating within himself, 
		and why the scripture speaks of twins struggling within the womb. This 
		is why it is 
		written, "I would not have you ignorant; for the end shall not come, except there be a falling away, 
		first." </span> <br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">The fabled phoenix once flew near the Source of Light, but 
		its wings caught fire, and the creature burned, falling to the ground at 
		its first approach to the light of heaven. Having fallen back to Earth, 
		it was incumbent upon the phoenix to gather itself from its ashes and to rise again. A roughly equivalent 
		experience 
		unfolds as natural man is consumed by inward fires, is reborn of the Holy Breath and 
		rises again as spiritual man, 
		joining the procession leading to the great wedding feast of the
		</span>
		<a href="../Matthew/matthew1.html" class="auto-style85">Messiah of 
		Matthew 1:1</a>, in<span class="auto-style85"> the steps of
		</span>
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html" class="auto-style85">the man of Matthew 1:16</a><span class="auto-style85">. In their 
		awakend state, walking the Earth in tandem with the Salvation that comes 
		by the will of God, believers are able to add knowledge to experience as, 
		rising from the ashes of the errors, they again 
		approach the gates of Heaven.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">It is inevitable that the new 
		creature rising from the waters of baptism should stumble. Offense will 
		come, and woe to them who are the cause of it; but mercy and restoration 
		will come upon those who must experience offense.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">If we say we are without sin, we 
		deceive ourselves; and the truth is not in us. If we confess our 
		errors-- our sins, however, the Holy Father of us all is faithful to forgive us and to 
		cleanse us from all unrighteousness.The filthy rags we wore in unrighteousness 
		are replaced with spotless clothing not in the pew, but in the world's 
		ditches, as those putting on the whoe armour of God in Messiah Yahushua lend helping hands to fallen 
		brothers. Should believers cordon themselves off from others they perceive 
		to be unrighteous sinners in order to protect their mistaken sense of their own 
		righteousness, they will discover that their lamps lack oil at the great 
		wedding feast. Itcomes nearer with every darkening day of Earth.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">If we say we have no sin, no error, we deceive ourselves; and the Truth
