		<td class="auto-style93"><span class="auto-style85">The name Lucifer means "Light Bearer." 
		The negative connotations stem from tradition, and that's alright; 
		because those who have yet to question their priorities are ill-equipped 
		for conclusions; their fous is parameters. That focus leads them to 
		outward observances because every thought of any such is his or her 
		reflection in the consciousness of others. As companions are perceived 
		as strangers, once removed, so are conceptions of the godhead, which is 
		not without benefit.<br><br>Lucifer was a wonderful light bearer: 
		everything one might ask for, were it not for the iniquity. This stain, 
		if stain it was, could not have been intrinsic to Lucifer's character; 
		for he was perfect in all his ways. Iniquity was unknown in him or by 
		him or of him until it was discovered, there. And when it was 
		discovered, the fall was not only immediate, but necessary: because of 
		mercy and by reason of the love of HaShem <span class="auto-style86">
		hwhy</span>, in whom we also live, moving, in accordance with our states 
		of being.<br><br>The 
		covering cherub of heaven, Lucifer was perfect in all his ways until iniquity 
		was found in him. It's commonly understood that "iniquity" is "grossly 
		unfair or immoral behavior." If that's the case, then Lucifer's pervious perfection was 
		a matter of the being's performance, rather than the predictable result 
		of his character. In such a case, perfection was his&nbsp; to maintain 
		and his to lose whenever resolve should fail. And should it fail, 
		opening the cherub to regret, iniquity would have its way, wreaking 
		havoc on the soul and its inhabitants. Should it bring failure, the inquity found in the Light Bearer 
		would better be attributed to the corrosive effect of narcissistic 
		pride, as it's written, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a 
		fall." The fault, then, is to be found in the being, not in the being's 
		actions or reactions.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">If Lucifer's fall was due to 
		an innate wickedness, the question 
		arises: "What was God's intent when appointing the great angel with the 
		fatal flaw as the 
		'covering cherub'?" That he should&nbsp; be mocked, when the inmiquity 
		has its way?We are instructed that HaShem, alone, is perfect in 
		all his ways; and so, Lucifer was perfect only so far as he rested in 
		the perfection of the Father. My view&nbsp; is that the imperfection discovered in 
		Lucifer was manifestation of a bending within the light for which the 
		cherub was responsible. In a sense, iniquity overtook Ludifer in his 
		perfect performance of obligation; it was in no way intrinsic to his 
		character, nor did it have greater consequence that the gift of Light 
		with with Lucifer was first entrusted.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Lucifer's fall was subsequent to the 
		creation of Earth: for the judgment applied to him 
		was that he should be cast down to Earth, where he would live and die as 
		a human being. Perfect before iniquity was 
		found in him, the failing must have "crept into him: unawares," to 
		borrow the phrase. How, then, can righteous God accuse him of error. He 
		served in his capacity, perfect in all his ways, until it was found. 
		Lucifer was not God's enemy. He was perfect.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">If fault 
		there was, the the explanatioin must concern th light Lucifer carried, 
		rather than the nature of his soul. Were it not so, one would have to 
		argue that God willfully chose to create a monster to compete for the 
		love of mankind. That's psychopathological. No, was due to the nature of 
		the light he carried. Because light is a created thing, we understand 
		that it sometimes speaks in parables. The mystic has his views, but the 
		realist insists that the dynamics of Light follow codes that are 
		imbedded and operative 
		within all created things. <br><br>As are we all in every moment of 
		every day, light is subject to the pull of inertia. A created 
		manifestation, Light has mass: it would radiate from its source, 
		following a straight line into infinity, were it not for the mass 
		intrinsic to its manifestation. Light consists of photons; and their 
		weight establishes a latent, gravitational force, which we call inertia. 
		Inertia acts upon what is, changing it into what was before it is again, 
		but somewhat differently. It's the spur to accretion. Without the gravitational 
		miracle of accretion, there would be no Creation; for accretion, child 
		of intertia, provides the skeleton for all that life supports.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">That being 
		the case, the conclusion is that iniquity has little to do with the tug-of-war between light 
		and darkness, good and evil. As suggested, iniquity is the spiritual equivalent of the latent 
		force of inertia. This is a reasonable conclusion; for the invisible 
		things of God are visible in the things that are made, suggesting that 
		iniquity is spiritual gravity, whose weighty pull marred Lucifer's 
		perfection. </span> <br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">Just as natural light curves as it arcs across the 
		vast dimensions of the universe because of the pull of mass, spiritual 
		light is also affected by body mass, whether the life form is human or 
		angelic. I don't believe that the fate of Lucifer was the result of sin 
		or some behavioral error, precisely; rather, I think the iniquity found in 
		him was reflective of the nature of the Light, itself: At the core of all 
		things, light is the cohesive element of the universe. Even rocks are 
		children of Light; for over eons, light became trapped in the pull of 
		matter. Rocks absorb it, vegetation drinks it down, storing it in roots, 
		that it may transform it into food to sustain animal&nbsp; life. Without 
		the phenomenon of light, there would be no measurable thing any where.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">I conclude that Lucifer's fall did not disqualify him 
		from grace; for the iniquity found in him was not of his doing, but was 
		akin to the pull inertia imposes upon Creation' matter. Neither good nor 
		bad, inertia is a latent force capable of bending light; and Lucifer's 
		imperfection was among its effects. With the command, "Let there be," 
		Lucifer was fated to tumble from the immortal realm into the mortal realm, 
		because , through Creation, he became vulnerable to the phenomenon of acretion, which is akin to incarnation. 
		Although light has a nearly negligible mass, the weight of its photons 
		renders it succeptible to the iniquity of gravity.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Beginnings 
		have endings. The loss of Lucifer's heavenly state brought radical change, but not 
		tragic change. God is good. Aware of that goodness, the angels of HaShem shouted for joy at 
		the creation of 
		man, whose physical form, comprised of stored light that is capable of 
		receiving, then reflecting or projecting, spiritual light as well.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">As time unfolded, mankind would become chariots of Ruach HaQodesh, 
		God's Holy Spirit, serving as vehicles for angelic transformation. 
		Living and dying as men, the hosts of heaven would enter upon the task 
		of establishing unique identities they could carry into life 
		everlasting, which was HaShem's intent, from the beginning. The great 
		wedding feast aproaches; and on that day, the incarnate souls who loved 
		the Light of God will become transfigured, no longer mere <em>bearers</em> 
		of Light, but as beings of Light.Working out their perfection during 
		their lives on Earth, they shall become transformed into <em>beings</em> 
		of Light through the renewal of their minds. </span> 
		<br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<img class="auto-style77" height="354" src="../cd/phoenix.gif" style="float: left" width="187"><span class="auto-style85">This 
		mystery is among 
		the things the early followers of Y'shua were unable to bear. They were 
		unprepared:&nbsp; not because of 
		failings or weaknesses, but because the demands of order follow 
		sequence. The walk in the steps of messiah is led and paced by Ruach 
		HaQodesh, which rewards he faithful with gifts of knowledge concerning 
		the nature and ways of HaShem. 
		There was war--unruliness-- in Heaven because it was of paramount 
		importance that God's sons learn and understand "this," so&nbsp; they 
		would be able to endure, conquer, and triumph over "that."</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">In times past, the apostle lamented that the mystery of iniquity was 
		alr already at work among early believers in the Way, the Truth, and the 
		Life. From the last seder of mashiyach Y'shua to the uproars of this 
		present day, stumbles among believers were apparent and remain apparent. 
		The weight of iniquity takes its toll because the lessons are difficult: 
		impossible, except through the guidance of HaShem, and that's the point: 
		the path of the cross 
		leads to knowledge of the intersection of the mortal and immortal 
		realms, teaching us of God's love as we make our way back home. Far greater than the light 
		found in natural man, the Light within spiritual man is the very 
		essence of the Godhead. Called to walk in the perfection of Father and 
		Son, mankind must carry the Treasure of God's Light, which is the very 
		Life of HaShem, in 
		earthen vessels that must have an end.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">Living the life of the Spirit in mortal bodies 
		is a dynamic experience, and the mass of physical man man's body exerts 
		the 
		equivalent of the latent force of inertia within the new creature, the 
		spiritual man. This is why Paul saw two laws operating within himself, 
		and why the scripture speaks of twins struggling within the womb. This 
		is why it is 
		written, "I would not have you ignorant; for the end shall not come, except there be a falling away, 
		first." </span> <br class="auto-style85"><br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">The fabled phoenix once flew near the Source of Light, but 
		its wings caught fire, and the creature burned, falling to the ground at 
		its first approach to the light of heaven. Having fallen back to Earth, 
		it was incumbent upon the phoenix to gather itself from its ashes and to rise again. A roughly equivalent 
		experience 
		unfolds as natural man is consumed by inward fires, is reborn of the Holy Breath and 
		rises again as spiritual man, 
		joining the procession leading to the great wedding feast of the
		</span>
		<a href="../Matthew/matthew1.html" class="auto-style85">Messiah of 
		Matthew 1:1</a>, in<span class="auto-style85"> the steps of
		</span>
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html" class="auto-style85">the man of Matthew 1:16</a><span class="auto-style85">. In their 
		awakend state, walking the Earth in tandem with the Salvation that comes 
		by the will of God, believers are able to add knowledge to experience as, 
		rising from the ashes of the errors, they again 
		approach the gates of Heaven.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">It is inevitable that the new 
		creature rising from the waters of baptism should stumble. Offense will 
		come, and woe to them who are the cause of it; but mercy and restoration 
		will come upon those who must experience offense.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85"><span class="auto-style85">If we say we are without sin, we 
		deceive ourselves; and the truth is not in us. If we confess our 
		errors-- our sins, however, the Holy Father of us all is faithful to forgive us and to 
		cleanse us from all unrighteousness.The filthy rags we wore in unrighteousness 
		are replaced with spotless clothing not in the pew, but in the world's 
		ditches, as those putting on the whoe armour of God in Messiah Yahushua lend helping hands to fallen 
		brothers. Should believers cordon themselves off from others they perceive 
		to be unrighteous sinners in order to protect their mistaken sense of their own 
		righteousness, they will discover that their lamps lack oil at the great 
		wedding feast. Itcomes nearer with every darkening day of Earth.</span><br class="auto-style85">
		<br class="auto-style85">
		<span class="auto-style85">If we say we have no sin, no error, we deceive ourselves; and the Truth 
		is not in us. By 
		this we shall know that we are disciples of Master Y'shua, the Essene 
		Teacher of Righteousness: that we 
		have love for one another: and not only for others we see as good, but 
		for all who live. </span> <br class="auto-style85">
