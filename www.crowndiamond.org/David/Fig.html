			Walking with Messiah, but not in HaMashiyach, it is very easy to 
			imagine ourselves to be finished works: we are “saved,” and nothing 
			more is required of us. We read that “faith without works is dead,” 
			but we convince ourselves that holding a door open for somebody or 
			sharing a few goods qualify as works—and they might, don’t get me 
			wrong; but they only qualify if such works are seen as an offering, 
			in which case they are of faith. If they are seen as an 
			accomplishment that brings entitlement, then they are korban: 
			faithful in form only, the result of our own, private initiatives; 
			not in tandem with the will and hand of Father Yah. We imagine that 
			we’ve done what works the day required, and that nothing more can be 
			expected of us.<br />
			<br />
			Well, yes and no; and in HaMashiyach is yes.<br />
			<br />
			When I consider my standing in HaMashiyach, I believe that what I 
			see as "me" is not who I really am in the mind of God. The image I 
			have of myself is an idolatrous representation. I don’t have the 
			proper perspective to judge who I am, in Truth. What I understand to 
			be me is actually a wall with a window, through which I can glimpse 
			the structure of who I actually am. Every screenshot the rational 
			mind might take as it peeks through my spiritual eyes is, in fact, a 
			brazen image: dead, lifeless, impotent, powerless. I might bat my 
			physical eyes in satisfaction, but blinking, the image fades; and 
			I’m unsatisfied, hungry for the transformation I understand to be 
			required, but cannot fathom.<br />
			<br />
			As the window appears to my conscious, now, I have little interest 
			in self-knowledge. I wish I could say I have no more interest in 
			knowledge of self; but were I to make that claim--the claim that I’m 
			free of sin, of error—I would be a liar, and Truth has no part in my 
			conclusion. Admitting that, having received the Holy Spirit baptism 
			54 years ago, I am as yet imperfect is a wonderful step forward.<br />
			<br />
			As an apostle wrote, he didn't even judge himself, lamenting 
			“miserable wretch that I am, who shall deliver me from this death?” 
			The deliverer cannot come if we see ourselves as having been 
			delivered. How then, can I who admit to being blind when it comes to 
			understanding my own stature in the eyes of HaShem? How can I 
			perceive myself? This parable is my answer: the clearest view of my 
			true self I can manage is the obverse of Solomon’s Song, in which he 
			says that his love is as one peeking through the lattice, peering 
			through the window.<br />
			<br />
			Now, “obverse” may not be clear to some, so I’ll restate it this 
			way. Looking at myself with sinful eyes, with erroneous vision, I 
			see an impenetrable wall in which there is a small window. Trying to 
			look out the window, however, my eyes are distracted by the window 
			frame, a distraction that works tirelessly to recapture and lock my 
			vision not on the window, but upon the wall by which the window is 
			framed. It’s the window that gives the view I want, not the window 
			frame or the looming wall of darkness in which it is situated. If I 
			can keep peeking, peering through the window, measuring what is 
			revealed by that opening as I walk in HaMashiyach, my footsteps will 
			hasten me to the place where I am walking in HaMashiyach, not after 
			the Messiah.<br />
			<br />
			Should I satisfy myself with glimpses of Truth, content in the 
			truths I discover while examining who I am with the eyes of a 
			creature, not the eyes of HaMashiyach, I may achieve a kind of yoga: 
			a kind of full-fledged self-knowledge; but try as I might, I will 
			never understand myself as seen in the eyes of the Creator. Those 
			who spend their lives trying to master themselves (I’m fifty-four in 
			the Spirit and eighty in the flesh; and so, I’ve nothing to boast 
			about): the masters of self are as spiritual cave dwellers. A 
			lifetime of spelunking has taught me what the scripture plainly 
			states: that, in me as a creature, there is no good thing.<br />
			<br />
			How is it, then, that I am continually distracted by the wall 
			standing where it ought not, by the antichrist within, striving to 
			claim my right to a holy place in HaMashiyach, hoping to find some 
			good thing I can use to drive out all the bad things? I am like the 
			fig tree, covered with leaves of promise, but fruitless. Reformed 
			self acts like a supplanter. It will block any view through the 
			window if it finds satisfaction in the light filtering through the 
			leaves of the unseasonable fig tree the view is blocked, I can 
			continue to court a curse against my true self by persisting in 
			narcissistic meditation, or I can open to HaMashiyach’s blessings by 
			heeding those little shifts that return my focus to the window view. 
			If I hold to the window, then I walk with Messiah in HaMashiyach.<br />
			<br />
			Holding to the view through the window is not something I can 
			accomplish that on my own. Experience has taught me that, twisting 
			myself this way and that to gain a clearer view ends one way: the 
			wheels will come off, and I'll have more than my fill of the mess 
			that threatens to overtake me. The saying, “pulling myself up by my 
			bootstraps” is a cruel joke. Good luck with that; for I will be 
			certain to lose my balance, falling God-knows-where!The Parable of

			accomplish that on my own. Experience has taught me that, twisting

			bootstraps” is a cruel joke. Good luck with that; for I will be 
			certain to lose my balance, falling God-knows-where!<br />
			<br />
			No: to hold the view through the window, I need the help of the 
			Deliverer: not some magical intervention, but the inward touch that 
			reassures me of the grace called forgiveness that’s the gift of God, 
			whose mercy endures forever. When I recognize that the seemingly 
			honest impulses from my wicked heart to pass judgment on the 
			iterations, I call myself are stumbling blocks, then I might be 
			judged as ready to see through the window, once again. Should the 
			view be restored in its fullness in answer to my call, the view 
			through the window of is seen for what it is: the way of escape. 
			Holding fast to what I perceive of HaMashiyach from that 
			perspective, I then experience the glorious liberty that come from 
			the walk with Messiah; for I am then as HaMashiyach, and the 
			heavenly Mashiyach, fights for me, as I hold my peace.<br />
			<br />
			Yes, I can learn more about what a stinker I am if I lock my 
			attention on the belly button; but everything I learn there actually 
			builds up the wall, bolstering it, distracting me from the business 
			of the Temple made without human hands. “Learn what this means, I 
			will have mercy, not sacrifice.” For if I cease from my own works, 
			in which I constantly judge myself, the mercy of HaShem will enlarge 
			my heart, opening the window so that the great, speckled bird can 
			take wing, joining HaMashiyach where he is. I must honestly desire 
			to ride the magic carpet of prayer out, through the window, as 
			HaMashiyach beckons. And as he beckons, I will discover lasting 
			remedies for proclivities I'd rather not think about, anyway; for 
			I'll be taught by my dance with HaMashiyach, Immanuel.<br />
			<br />
			If we give no thought to what we shall say, nor what we shall do as 
			we pass through the window, we the glorious liberty of the Sons of 
			God. To meditate in this manner is to perform the dance of Miryam 
			Magdala. Dancing with HaMashiyach like the spinning Sufis of Iran, 
			the seven foul spirits that anchored us in the wall of flesh will be 
			left behind; for we tango with HaMashiyach on the rungs of Jacob's 
			Ladder, and we must abandon ourselves in his embrace.<br />
			<br />
			All that we are leads us to that point. In him is yea, not yea and 
			nay. All things are lawful if they are expedient, if they edify, and 
			if they do not involve submitting ourselves or forcing others to 
			fall under the power of any, whether it be thing or person. We must 
			understand the commandments as prophecies rather than dictums; but 
			those prophecies cannot be fulfilled so long as we entertain 
			delusions that we’re equipped to lead in that dance. Following 
			HaMashiyach’s lead, we are transfigured, not reformed. When the wall 
			or those who trust in the wall threaten to cut in, waltzing us away 
			from the Lord, then we must hold our peace while the Messiah who 
			came in the room of HaMashiyach writes in the sand with his finger 
			all the while the separatists and the theologians make accusation.<br />
			<br />
			Yes, we are to come out from among them and be separate in our walk 
			upon Earth. But the proper kind of separation cannot be accomplished 
			by an act of will. No man can separate himself from himself, gaining 
			freedom to join with HaMashiyach. Not a single one of us: the Father 
			draws us into the Sons of Man.<br />
			The fig tree is cursed because, in passing it, we trace the path to 
			Yerushaliem that ends with tables being overturned, parasites must 
			be driven out, and so much more, requiring us to return to 
			Beit-AnYah, the Place of Longing Spirits. Anything one can do on 
			one's own is just the shadow of things coming along the road to 
			Gulgolta.<br />
			Making the way straight, the Baptist teaches, "He must increase; I 
			must decrease." Yeah. Yahuchanan could not accomplish this by 
			pulling on his bootstraps or by loosening the strings of what he 
			could see of the HaMashiyach’s sandals. We can exercise mortal wills 
			to resist the weight of our mortal shoes, but that's a futile 
			struggle. Sure, the devil will flee, laughing as we tug against the 
			gravity of our own mass; but he'll be back. HaMashiyach will wash 
			our feet if we let him. He will say to us, this is the way you 
			should go: not forever, perhaps; but on this day! Walk in it. If on 
			another day HaMashiyach should point to an adjoining road, sending 
			that way on that day, why should it be a problem?!<br />
			<br />
			HaMashiyach has the perspective to know the way we must go when we 
			must do so. It is for us to walk in it. Forgetting who we are should 
			be as an afterthought, while we walk as men; for the day is coming 
			when what we are now shall be as though it had never been. If we 
			must boast, let us boast in HaMashiyach, who not only tells us which 
			way we should go and what we should do, but also what we shall say: 
			to the end that all shall know him, even as all are known by him; 
			and he will fill all in all, face upon face, upon faces.<br />
			<br />
			Amen.<br />

		<td class="auto-style3" colspan="3">I’ve known for some time that evil 
		is maligned by common usage. My understanding isn’t remarkable: the 
		prophet Isaiah said as much, so long ago, complaining that we put good 
		for evil and evil for good. One of the reasons we’re not to judge is 
		that it’s a waste of time. <br><br class="auto-style14">We don’t have 
		the perspective, but we’ve been given the clue: it’s those nasty old 
		figs! Isaiah wrote of evil figs, but then he wrote of figs that were SO 
		evil! Now, that proves my point. Evil is not the opposite of good. Evil 
		is the continuum that stretches from good to wickedness. All figs that 
		are just a little bit off are evil: some more, some less. The opposite 
		of good is wickedness.<br><br class="auto-style14">Just a man, my best 
		works are evil. On my own, I can do no better. If the works done in me 
		are of Ruach HaQodesh, it’s a blessing all around. Otherwise, be warned: 
		you’re taking your chances. I’ll not agree with the apostle who wrote, 
		“Follow me as I follow (that word). No. Follow the Word and skip the 
		need to judge whether a brother is or is not true. <br>
		<br class="auto-style14">By their fruit you shall know them, yes; but 
		give them a little slack! “If we say we have no sin, no error, no evil, 
		we deceive ourselves and the Truth is not in us.” Peter had the vision 
		of a sheet full of nastiness descending upon him. The word to him, “Call 
		not that which I have cleansed” . . . You can fill in the blank. We’re 
		all brothers, and there are ditches and potholes aplenty. <br>
		<br class="auto-style14">Samaritans are needed at all times and 
		everywhere: if we can’t quite make it to “good,” we might manage to be 
		better than awful; for it’s written, I can do all things through (that 
		word) that strengthens me.<br>Walking with Messiah, but not in

		and that to gain a clearer view ends one way: the wheels will come off, 
		and I'll have more than my fill of the mess that threatens to overtake 
		me. The saying, “pulling myself up by my bootstraps” is a cruel joke. 
		Good luck with that; for I will be certain to lose my balance, falling 
		God-knows-where!<br><br>No: to hold the view through the window, I need 
		the help of the Deliverer: not some magical intervention, but the inward 
		touch that reassures me of the grace called forgiveness that’s the gift 
		of God, whose mercy endures forever. When I recognize that the seemingly 
		honest impulses from my wicked heart to pass judgment on the iterations, 
		I call myself are stumbling blocks, then I might be judged as ready to 
		see through the window, once again. Should the view be restored in its 
		fullness in answer to my call, the view through the window of is seen 
		for what it is: the way of escape. Holding fast to what I perceive of 
		HaMashiyach from that perspective, I then experience the glorious 
		liberty that come from the walk with Messiah; for I am then as 
		HaMashiyach, and the heavenly Mashiyach, fights for me, as I hold my 
		peace.<br><br class="auto-style14">Yes, I can learn more about what a stinker I am if I lock 
		my attention on the belly button; but everything I learn there actually 
		builds up the wall, bolstering it, distracting me from the business of 
		the Temple made without human hands. “Learn what this means, I will have 
		mercy, not sacrifice.” For if I cease from my own works, in which I 
		constantly judge myself, the mercy of HaShem will enlarge my heart, 
		opening the window so that the great, speckled bird can take wing, 
		joining HaMashiyach where he is. I must honestly desire to ride the 
		magic carpet of prayer out, through the window, as HaMashiyach beckons. 
		And as he beckons, I will discover lasting remedies for proclivities I'd 
		rather not think about, anyway; for I'll be taught by my dance with 
		HaMashiyach, Immanuel.<br><br class="auto-style14">If we give no thought to what we shall 
		say, nor what we shall do as we pass through the window, we the glorious 
		liberty of the Sons of God. To meditate in this manner is to perform the 
		dance of Miryam Magdala. Dancing with HaMashiyach like the spinning 
		Sufis of Iran, the seven foul spirits that anchored us in the wall of 
		flesh will be left behind; for we tango with HaMashiyach on the rungs of 
		Jacob's Ladder, and we must abandon ourselves in his embrace.<br>
		<br class="auto-style14">All 
		that we are leads us to that point. In him is yea, not yea and nay. All 
		things are lawful if they are expedient, if they edify, and if they do 
		not involve submitting ourselves or forcing others to fall under the 
		power of any, whether it be thing or person. We must understand the 
		commandments as prophecies rather than dictums; but those prophecies 
		cannot be fulfilled so long as we entertain delusions that we’re 
		equipped to lead in that dance. Following HaMashiyach’s lead, we are 
		transfigured, not reformed. When the wall or those who trust in the wall 
		threaten to cut in, waltzing us away from the Lord, then we must hold 
		our peace while the Messiah who came in the room of HaMashiyach writes 
		in the sand with his finger all the while the separatists and the 
		theologians make accusation.<br><br class="auto-style14">Yes, we are to come out from among 
		them and be separate in our walk upon Earth. But the proper kind of 
		separation cannot be accomplished by an act of will. No man can separate 
		himself from himself, gaining freedom to join with HaMashiyach. Not a 
		single one of us: the Father draws us into the Sons of Man.<br>
		<br class="auto-style14">The 
		fig tree is cursed because, in passing it, we trace the path to 
		Yerushaliem that ends with tables being overturned, parasites must be 
		driven out, and so much more, requiring us to return to Beit-AnYah, the 
		Place of Longing Spirits. Anything one can do on one's own is just the 
		shadow of things coming along the road to Gulgolta.<br>
		<br class="auto-style14">Making the 
		way straight, the Baptist teaches, "He must increase; I must decrease." 
		Yeah. Yahuchanan could not accomplish this by pulling on his bootstraps 
		or by loosening the strings of what he could see of the HaMashiyach’s 
		sandals. We can exercise mortal wills to resist the weight of our mortal 
		shoes, but that's a futile struggle. Sure, the devil will flee, laughing 
		as we tug against the gravity of our own mass; but he'll be back. 
		HaMashiyach will wash our feet if we let him. He will say to us, this is 
		the way you should go: not forever, perhaps; but on this day! Walk in 
		it. If on another day HaMashiyach should point to an adjoining road, 
		sending that way on that day, why should it be a problem?!<br>
		<br class="auto-style14">
		HaMashiyach has the perspective to know the way we must go when we must 
		do so. It is for us to walk in it. Forgetting who we are should be as an 
		afterthought, while we walk as men; for the day is coming when what we 
		are now shall be as though it had never been. If we must boast, let us 
		boast in HaMashiyach, who not only tells us which way we should go and 
		what we should do, but also what we shall say: to the end that all shall 
		know him, even as all are known by him; and he will fill all in all, 
		face upon face, upon faces.<br><br class="auto-style14">Amen.</td>
