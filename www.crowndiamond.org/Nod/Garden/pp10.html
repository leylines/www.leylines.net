		<div class="auto-style210">
		Before the commandment came, we walked with 
		<a href="../../cd/God.html">God</a>; but through 
		misapprehension and subsequent errors of misunderstanding, we became 
		estranged from the intimacy of that walk; and we long for its 
		restoration. The primal sense of loss is real, and yet it is mistaken; 
		for unawares—as though from within some other dimension, we walk with 
		Elohim every moment of our extraordinary days as we experience and 
		share, together, the Indwelling Presence of the Breath of Life: 
		Immanu<span class="auto-style211">AL</span>, God within us.</div>
		<p style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;" class="auto-style210">
		Whether we see ourselves as standing together as One at the end of this 
		present age, or whether we yet cling to the old-world fiction that 
		personal isolation is justification for the pursuit of material 
		advantage, we stagger under the weight of cycles we cannot fully 
		comprehend. Dazed and quite possibly imperiled, our only objective 
		certainty is that the world to which we have become accustomed is going, 
		if not gone, and that it will not return. Plagued with uncertainty, we 
		do our best to strengthen our resolve, intending to keep doing much as 
		we’ve been doing all along, so long as we are able. We’ve become captive 
		to tarnished lives; for even those who seem comfortable in the injustice 
		that engulfs us are languishing—as in the days of Noah.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;" class="auto-style210">
		<o:p>When that patriarchal age came to a close, 
		<a href="../Noah/Noah.html">Noah</a>
		was given a pattern for the preservation of life. The Ark was 
		constructed in compliance with specific measurements, whose ratios are 
		found in the hexagram, the cube, the 
		<a href="../../cd/key.html">Shield of David</a>, and in the very 
		ancient symbol known as Adam Kadmon, a name that can be translated as 
		the “Projection of Man.”</o:p></p>

		<o:p>
		<img height="133" src="ak.30.gif" style="float: left; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px" width="70">The 
		arms of David’s Shield are as the cliffs of
		Mount Ararat; for the ratios of the Ark come to rest upon the Shield’s 
		shoulders, a relationship demonstrated in the Crown Diamond, whose root 
		is 
		<a href="../../cd/adam.html">Adam Kadmon</a>. The Diamond can be seen as the symbol of David’s 
		Buckler; for its geometry magnifies the two-dimensional pattern used by 
		Moses for the compilation of the 
		<a href="../../cd/torah.html">Torah as it appeared</a> in the days of
		<a href="../../Matthew/20David.html">King David</a>. The script of the original Torah—along with the letters of 
		all Western alphabets, with Indo-Arabic numerals, and with so much 
		more—can be mapped upon its grid.</o:p></p>

		<img height="165" src="proFlip.gif" style="float: right; margin-left: 6px; margin-right: 6px" width="42">If 
		only a boat, Noah’s Ark is lost to history, but its <span class="auto-style195">pattern</span> is not. The pattern of the Ark has long been a 
		focus of kabbalah, the collective spiritual works and 
		rabbinical 
		teachings passed, by tradition, from one generation to another. Over 
		time, due to appreciation of its root in Adam Kadmon, the Ark’s pattern 
		and its implications have spread abroad; and now, the pattern is 
		commonly understood to be both the symbol of Man and of the Tree of 
		Life; for the pattern is reflected in the human organism, which, itself, 
		is made in the image—according to the likeness, the similitude, the 
		<span class="auto-style195">pattern</span>—of God.<o:p></o:p></o:p></p>

		<o:p>
		<o:p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		The mystical kabbalah is derived
		from the written Torah, and the measurements of Adam Kadmon turn the 
		page because its parables adhere to its logic. In reference to a great 
		falling away, however, Torah is called the book that is sealed. Looking 
		forward to our day, perhaps, Isaiah prophesied that the seals will open 
		on a magnified Torah, made glorious, magnificent by HaShem.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></o:p></o:p></p>

		Wonders remain to be discovered within Torah, therefore; for the Tree of 
		Lives, which is integral to its narrative, has twelve manner of fruits, 
		which are to appear in their seasons—in their times. In a literal sense, 
		those times are again pressing upon us in the budding foliage of the 
		Crown Diamond; for it is imprinted with the pattern to </span>

		do</i> know the pattern to which the prophets speak; for we live <i>
		within</i> that pattern as expressed by the mathematics of Creation, 
		which are the mathematics of Torah. As this present age comes to a 
		close, we sense that the ancient pattern given to Noah and authenticated 
		on Sinai is now blossoming, anew: that a new age is coming, both upon us 
		and within us. We sense that humanity is being readied for fulfillment 
		of promise: when all that is without will mirror the peace that shall

		alike, along with every sentiment scribbled down by men of the West, can 
		be traced upon its grid: mapped within it in the spiritual 
		sense, also; for the Diamond’s lines follow the logic of Adam Kadmon, 
		the image of Man as projected in the likeness of Elohim. Further, 
		because the chakras of Eastern civilization are inherent to the 
		intersecting lines of the Crown Diamond, its symbolism has its 
		corollaries within many cultures. Like the Lotus, it is a platform for 
		prayer.</span></span></span></p>

		could say to a mountain, through faith believing, “Be removed”; and it 
		would go, whether made of earth or of some ineffable, spiritual essence; 
		for with Elohim in a quantum universe, nothing shall be impossible. 
		Rooted in the geometry of Creation, the pattern of biblical words was 
		demonstrated to Moses on Sinai; and those who study the Crown Diamond 
		find themselves standing beside him, now, at another Pisgah, overlooking 
		a new land: one flowing with the milk and honey of a new science for men

		<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		There’s a fundamental distinction between language and speech. We know 
		not the significance of what we speak, but we are learning. Language is 
		the pattern of a linguistic system, and speech is the specific 
		utilization of that pattern for communication. </span>

		We 
		understand that the meanings of the words in any specific language can 
		be amplified or mitigated by the art of speech. We understand, also, 
		that what is said has its impact upon and within both those who hear and 
		those who speak. Delivery matters, but the 
		<span class="auto-style195">leverage</span> of speech 
		derives from the power of language, itself, and not from any clever 
		enunciation of its words. Incantation is useless self-abuse, unless it 
		addresses specific measurements inherent to a precise context, which 
		would make for short speech. </span>

		Before rediscovery of the
		Crown Diamond diagram, a word’s meanings were driven primarily by usage 
		associated with sound in specific locales during specific eras. Now that 
		a word’s etymology can be studied through the lens of two-dimensional 
		geometry, a new science has arrived. Before we can say much about its 
		implications for future studies of Torah and other writings, we must 
		learn more about the operations of language in the simplistic confines 
		of the Diamond’s two-dimensional representation as it relates to the 
		human body.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Torah was presented to Moses and to those with him, which included a 
		mixed multitude versed in the Phoenician language, now known as Sinaitic 
		Hebrew, as </span>Proto-Canaanite, as Ancient Arabic and Greek, and as Paleo. The language 
		of Torah’s Five Smooth Stones was the common language in Egypt at the 
		time of the Exodus. It served the Middle-Eastern peoples of Pharaoh’s 
		realm as the language of commerce, much as English does today throughout 
		the modern world. The language of Torah would have been understood by 
		almost everyone who fled Pharaoh. They were accustomed to it. 
		They used it.</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Torah was therefore written with everyday letters drawn to divine 
		specifications. When Moses wrote of the Garden in Sinaitic Hebrew, he 
		was under the imperative that the writing comport in precision with the 
		pattern impressed upon him by the Holy One who commanded him to write. 
		The Moses script was engraved in congruence with the geometry of 
		Creation, not in any tribal code. In reference to Torah in its original 
		language much later—after the key to knowledge had long been taken 
		away—the Nazarene explained, “I have food to eat you know not of.” His 
		food was Torah as read in the language of our Father and father Adam as 
		they walked the grounds of the Tree of Lives, together. </span>

		Eden is the story of the age
		of innocent perfection lost through error. As this present, 
		computerized, Industrial Age comes to an end, differences within and 
		among peoples have become too complicated to bridge. Ancient distortions 
		and errors have entered diverse thought processes, much like a virus, 
		corrupting the data in the collective subconscious, and turning the 
		conscious thoughts of diligent souls into whirling swords that detract 
		from a focused consideration of Principle—even by those souls whose 
		minds are committed to responsible inquiry.<o:p></o:p></p>
		<p style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		The clamor of accumulated error has imprisoned all of us, but the Essene 
		Teacher of Righteousness came to set us free by Truth. The man of 
		Galilee taught that Eden and its Kingdom of Names is within each of us, 
		and that the flimsy walls preventing clear vision of its contours are 
		quilted from inward seas of erroneous memories and blind surmise. If 
		HaShem permits, the emblems of the biblical language of Moses will, 
		again, restore the leverage needed to part the waters of the Sea of 
		Rods, that the children of the Most High might regain sure footing: both 
		as concerns the Sea of Reeds, which stretches out before us, and as 
		concerns River Jordan, which descends upon and within us, as from above.<o:p></o:p></p>
