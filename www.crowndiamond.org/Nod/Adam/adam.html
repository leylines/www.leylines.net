				<td><span class="auto-style73">In the Garden of Eden, the Breath of Life was 
				invested as the Life Spark</span><span class="auto-style74"> a&nbsp;
				</span><span class="auto-style73">in the blood</span><span class="auto-style74"> 
				md&nbsp; </span><span class="auto-style73">of Adam , the first man
				<span class="auto-style74">mda</span> , 
				and it has been passed and shared among us all, untold times. Through 
				its projection, that Life Breath, 
				and the spark of divine fire it carries, has warmed our bloodstreams by 
				positioning its energies within the thick darkness of the 
				physical body's cellular 
				structure. The Life Spark is Immanuel: God within us; and the 
				mortal 
				breath of man is strong argument for the existence of God, a greater 
				reality; for, ultimately, it answers to power that's 
				beyond our control. We can sometimes affect the mechanics of 
				breathing, but the magic of breath is absolutely beyond us.</span><br class="auto-style73"><br class="auto-style73">
				<span class="auto-style73">The Breath is both Life and the power 
				to enliven, and the holy fire of the Life Spark is never absent from 
				any of us, so long as we breathe. When we die, the Life 
				Spark returns to the Father of Life on the wings of his Breath, 
				carrying with it the ember of who we are and what we are 
				becoming, as was known from the beginning: not that we did not have 
				free choice; we did, but our choices took us to the places God 
				foresaw and to the strictures and remedies he prepared. As we move forward in our lives, we're sustained by the 
				Breath's Presence as we inhale; and we return to the Father the savor of our use of 
				his Breath and its Spark of Life, in the symbolic deaths of the exhale.</span><br class="auto-style73">
				<br class="auto-style73"><span class="auto-style73">Y'shua-- Jesus, if you like:&nbsp; we are not to make a man an offender for a word; 
				for that name both masks and amplifies Truth-- a wise man spoke of the Wheel, and of 
				the 
				need to keep our shoulders against it. Ask the men of the East 
				of the Wheel, and they will wonder how it could be a 
				mystery to men of the West. The man Jesus taught about the 
				<a href="../../cd/scarlet.html">Wheel of Lives</a>, even as 
				Torah's tree of life in the 
				Garden of Eden is written as the Tree of <em>Lives</em>. I 
				think short-sidedness 
				has come upon the West to underscore a still greater 
				mystery: there is a difference between transmigration of souls 
				and the transmutation of souls. Imperfect souls die, but awakened 
				souls need not perish to be reborn: new lives 
				can start with any breath, whenever sleeping souls awaken. </span> 
				<br class="auto-style73"><br class="auto-style73">
				<span class="auto-style73">The ritual of water baptism is just 
				that: a symbolic ritual. It's up to men, whether another can be 
				baptized in water, whereas the birth of the new creature of 
				which it is symbolic is not. Some emerge from the water in 
				fulfillment of all righteousness, but a great many arise with 
				the very devil grabbing at their heels. Yet others receive baptism in the Breath without ever 
				having heard of 
				baptisms of any kind. And concerning water baptism, it's 
				faith that saves, not willingness to be baptized. If 
				it's faith that brings us to baptism, we're not saved in perfection, but 
				<em>unto</em> 
				perfection; and should we come to water baptism by any other 
				understanding, then 
				we are fulfilling all righteousness with unrighteousness;&nbsp;for 
				error persists. No. It's the Breath that must lead us, down, to water; 
				for it's the Breath, as Finisher of our faith, 
				that arises from 
				the water with the embryonic saint, renewing our souls as it 
				accompanying us on the path to perfection, where we must persist in 
				the childbearing of our hearts and minds.</span><br class="auto-style73">
				<br class="auto-style73"><span class="auto-style73">We are to be perfected-- not only saved, but perfected! 
				Through the <em>process</em> of salvation, we are to become worthy of the 
				forehead seal first received by Y’shua. If we're not yet ready for 
				the forehead seal some call the circle of light, we progress by grace 
				upon the path of Y'shúa in the seal of the 
				Father’s hand. At rest and secure in the hand of</span><span class="auto-style74"> 
				hy </span><span class="auto-style73">Yah , we are 
				readied for those works entrusted to our own hands through 
				Yahushúa, the interface between God and creation.</span><br class="auto-style73">
				<br class="auto-style73">
				<span class="auto-style73">Nod is a land of wanderers—of sojourners; for it swallows both 
				the disinherited family of elder Cain and the chosen remnant of 
				the family of Adam, the only-begotten Son of God. <em>The Chronicles of Nod</em> is 
				based on an unusual reading of a holy text, but it 
				is not a private interpretation. My intellect did not contrive it. 
				Like Mohammed, I invite those who doubt its sincerity to try 
				contriving such a text for themselves. Its 
				narrative treats of the Life we share together as we travel the 
				Land of Nod together, in this present day. It's strengths praise 
				The Name, as does my weakness in expressing what I write. 
				Frankly, it's 
				amazing that work with any merit should come through such a one as 
				me.</span></td>
