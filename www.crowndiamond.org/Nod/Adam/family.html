		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		So powerful was the Shout of Creation, that 
		the Universe as it now stands, with its vast galaxies of matter and 
		anti-matter dancing in dimensions we can only suspect—the balanced 
		cohesion of all that, now, <span class="auto-style102">is</span>—the 
		Universe could not have withstood a second such shout. In his Wisdom, 
		therefore, God invested the intricacy of his first-and-only Shouted Word 
		with all that would be needed for the completion of everything his 
		eternal mind had intended, from the beginning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Creation could not contain Father </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: PaleoBora; mso-bidi-font-family: PaleoBora">
		hy</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">; 
		so he invested his Life within Creation through the sacrifice of 
		Enunciation, committing his enduring Presence to the constraints of time 
		by means of the command that there should 
		<span class="auto-style102">be</span>. 
		Before a thing was done on Earth—before the elements that would, later, 
		form the outer husks of Man had been gathered together into one place, 
		our heavenly Father </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: PaleoBora; mso-bidi-font-family: PaleoBora">
		hy</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;"> 
		had established, through Utterance of his Word, the remedy for every 
		contingency that might later arise because he had entrusted his Life to 
		the realms of time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style103" style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		For Creation to endure as a living organism, it would need to breathe: 
		it would have need of resiliency that would allow an opening and a 
		closing of the gap between the exhale of his Word and its inhale within 
		Creation. He had determined, therefore, that his saying, “Let there be,” 
		would establish an Interface between Creator and the created realms. 
		Without the Interface, life within the Universe would lack the ability 
		to utilize the Life Breath and would suffocate, long before Creation's 
		molecular structure gave way to chaos. <o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Breath is the savor of Life. The gap 
		preventing an orderly exchange of savors between Life and its 
		manifestations was infinitesimal in the Father's mind, but it was vast 
		and impassable by the scales of the material Creation. Thus, the Holy 
		Breath was to remain seated in realms beyond polarity and would stream 
		to Heaven and Earth through the Projected Interface, which would 
		administer Life according to the scale of its perceptions, in and beyond 
		time, as wheels turn within wheels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		The work of opening and closing the portals 
		between realms would be shouldered by the form that was created within 
		and by the Enunciation that there should 
		<span class="auto-style102">be</span>. The 
		Projection of Yah </span>

		projected from within himself. This metaphorical “Son” sits upon 
		Heaven’s throne as the Angel of the Presence, resting his feet on Earth. 
		Father’s Life is the Life of the Angel of the Presence, who quickens 
		those the Father draws unto him, that God’s will on Earth should be 
		done: to the end that all who merely live will inherit Life by bearing 
		the imprint of God’s Name. Hearing, accepting, and utilizing the pattern 
		within the Living Word, sleeping souls will awaken to Life, in the order 
		of their calling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		Although God permeates created realms, he 
		does not inhabit them. He is the source and substance of all realms, but 
		no realm is greater than, nor could any contain him, who is the source 
		of <span class="auto-style102">every</span> 
		realm.&nbsp;Where is the creature or creation that could contain him, 
		therefore?! The thought, the idea, the substance? In whatever realm the 
		question might arise, the Life that is in the Father is rooted 
		elsewhere. Not drawn from any realm or contained by any thought, the 
		Life that is in Father and Son is God's essence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		from the world’s foundation. When a matter must be addressed, it pleases 
		the Father to speak with the Small Voice that thunders within the breast 
		of the Presence. The Full Voice of the Father would shatter the material

		Door to the Father’s realm; for without its mediation, no man could 
		survive the encounter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style103" style="mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		HaShem dwells outside and beyond everything that appears; and yet he 
		knows the deepest secret of every soul that has ever drawn upon his 
		Breath. His thoughts for Man are like ripples atop a body of water, 
		which become as waves that break against the heart of the Only Begotten 
		Word and settle as pools of understanding in the hearts of Man. The 
		overflow of Father's thought feeds the Lake of Fire surrounding Heaven’s

		Seventh Day of Creation. <o:p></o:p></p>

		By means of the Interface—through the 
		Only-Begotten Presence—the living are able to measure the ripples of the 
		Father's counsel, as it laps against the spiritual bowls positioned 
		within Man. The Creator fashioned Adam after his likeness and according 
		to his express image; and the bowls in Man are the nexus between the 
		body’s nervous system and the soul’s spiritual centers. Heaven and Earth 
		are mirrored in body and soul; in like manner, the body’s nervous system 
		is organized after the pattern of the soul’s spiritual system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Associated with the spiritual bowls in Man 
		are the sephiroth of Adam Kadmon, the buds of the menorah and of the 
		candlesticks of the Churches of Asia, the Pillars of Islam, and the
		<span class="auto-style102">chakras</span> 
		of the East. In all of these are found fittings for the rungs of Jacob's 
		Ladder. Without light of their own, these bowls are nearly dark in 
		natural Man, but are trimmed in the interface between Man as son of Adam 
		and as son of God. They are enlightened by the touch of the Angel of the 
		Presence. <br><br>
		Those whose lamps burn bright can rise into 
		angelic realms upon Jacob's Ladder. In their ascent, some become 
		distracted by enigmatic truths engraved on the Ladder’s rungs. They turn 
		this way and that, hoping to gain knowledge for themselves. Neither 
		access nor progress come in answer to Man’s volition, however, nor by 
		will of the Only Begotten, but by the will of HaShem </span>

		So Adam, accompanied by Eve, his wife, 
		walked with HaShem among the trees of the Garden of an evening, speaking 
		through the agency of the Only-Begotten, the Angel of the Presence, the 
		Interface between the realms of the Father and realms created 
		<span class="auto-style102">by</span> the 
		Father. Like a breeze buffering higher wind as it stirs the branches 
		within a forest, the Small Voice of the Interface addresses the needs of 
		Creation, testing for resonance and listening for echoes as it wafts 
		against the spiritual bowls within all who live, gauging receptivity and 
		supplying each what each requires. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		The Father invested his Life within the Angel of the Presence, which 
		speaks for him in time and beyond time; for it was within him before 
		time and shall be gathered unto him, again, when time shall be no more. 
		Irrespective of time, then, both immaterial Father </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: PaleoBora; mso-bidi-font-family: PaleoBora">
		hy</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;"> 
		and his angelic Presence have Life in themselves, made One by the 
		function of interface, which shall also make the Sons of Man as One.<br>
		<br>Seeded in Adam's 
		first Breath as ImmanuAL, the Father’s Presence warms the bloodstreams 
		of mankind through interface, positioning and applying divine energies 
		as required, feeding them with spiritual sustenance that is available in 
		no other way. Those fed in this manner have no need of words to answer; 
		for, through the matrimonial interface, they sense the Father's thought 
		in the Son before it is spoken, and the counsel, measured by their 
		hearts, is received as affirmation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Ministering to souls who are friends as he walks among the inward 
		candlesticks, the Angel of the Presence reaches out to the chosen, 
		weaving their interface with the Father's Spirit: joining Spirit with 
		angelic spirits to form the three-strand cord that will lift their souls 
		ever higher. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		When Father Adam laid down his Life Spark on 
		behalf of Eve, his wife—when he chose, also, to eat and to die—the holy 
		fire of Wisdom flared in recognition of his love, radiating the warmth 
		of mercy throughout the Heavens and the Earth in celebration of the 
		savor of Adam's sacrifice; for the Life Spark Adam carried began to 
		fragment, and its sparks would surely be regathered in the perfected 
		hearts of the Sons of Man. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		“What has thou done?”! Neither would he nor
		<span class="auto-style102">could</span> 
		Adam perish forever, nor would any of the children waiting in his loins; 
		for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance. Of all that 
		ever lived, only one would be lost, that the commandment delivered at 
		the foot of the Tree of Life might be both upheld and fulfilled. The Son 
		of Perdition will perish, taking with him every hint of imperfection 
		when he drinks of the cup of oblivion prepared for Esau, the collective 
		husk of all imperfect souls, the cosmic foreskin of Man. Esau shall 
		drink, tumbling into the bottomless, taking with him all records of 
		error. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Adam tasted death because of error that was 
		not his own; and he would be reborn because of mercy, paving the way for 
		the salvation of his children. The tender tips of the vine of humanity 
		would flourish, enduring so long as the need for perfection might 
		require: until the sons of mortality shall have defeated death and 
		reclaimed the immortality sacrificed by father Adam in the Garden of 
		Bliss, so long ago. The Life that was in him will be multiplied 
		exceedingly; for unless a seed falls to the ground, it abides alone, and 
		it’s Father's will that all who taste of life come to Life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Whatever the condition of our mortal souls, 
		the very persistence of the Life within us, as we stumble along upon the 
		horn of death, is strong argument for the existence of the Ineffable 
		One; for at death's door with every breath we take, our questioning 
		minds find themselves tangling with concepts of God.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Whether we see God as an exterior power that 
		we must clothe with understandings, or as formless Spirit that will 
		clothe <span class="auto-style102">us</span>, 
		we wrestle valiantly with the task of finding words that can convey our 
		conclusions. Like Moses descending from Sinai, we find that the passion 
		we would share with others turns into golden calves in the heat of its 
		expression, and that those who receive our testimony into the fires of 
		their own hearts tend to mold our report—as sincere as it could have 
		been—into misshapen trinkets that, without intervention, would fill the 
		world with idolatry seeded, in part, by our own zeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Everyone must climb the mountains of Torah 
		on their own, under the auspices of the Father’s guidance. The existence 
		of God speaks of magic operating at scales beyond imagination; for the 
		Holy Breath is both Life, in itself, and it is also the power to 
		enliven. Unable to explain what we mean by “God,” we demure, saying 
		something like, “While mortal life persists, God simply 
		<span class="auto-style102">is</span>, 
		quickening who he will by whom he wills in whatever times and for 
		whatever purposes he wills.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		When any man is said to have died, the Life 
		within the Breath passes through his body’s cellular walls, and his 
		constituent parts are gathered to their fathers. The man’s Life returns 
		to its origins with Father </span>
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: PaleoBora; mso-bidi-font-family: PaleoBora">
		hy</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">, 
		who waits with open arms outside of Creation, peeping through the 
		windows and gazing through the lattice, that he might receive again that 
		which he sent forth. The Life Spark is regathered to its Father; and 
		from where it has gone, it will come again: through the Door of the 
		Interface, which is charged with raising each spark of Life to its 
		perfection, in accordance with predetermined order. The universe is as a 
		stepping stone for the Sons of Man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Wheels turn within wheels. None goes up into 
		Heaven but they who have first come down; therefore, Adam ate without 
		doubt: he was not deceived. He had known all crucial factors about 
		immortal Life before learning anything of that day’s events. He'd been 
		well taught in the evening walks; so he bowed his head to the fruit of 
		the lesser tree and ate because of the imperfection apparent, now, in 
		Eve. It was neither fitting nor bearable that he should abide alone, 
		having lost God’s gift.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
		<span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Palatino Linotype&quot;">
		Eve had eaten without knowing Adam’s 
		reaction to the serpent’s words. He might have intervened, saving them 
		both; but Eve’s confession fully accepted her own responsibility. Adam’s 
		silence as she deliberated eating gave her reason to blame him for her 
		error; but she hadn’t accused him, and neither had Adam accused her. 
		They stated fact. She would have forgiven him had he judged her, but he 
		hadn’t tempted her so, and his patient love made her his loving 
		prisoner. She would serve as his helpmate so long as the Father would 
		allow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		We are to be perfected—not only saved, but 
		perfected! Through the <span class="auto-style102">process</span>

		Nod is a land of wanderers—of sojourners; for it swallows both the 
		disinherited family of elder Cain and the chosen remnant of the family 
		of Adam, the Son of God. The Chronicles of Nod is based on an unusual 
		reading of the holy text of Torah, but it is not a private 
		interpretation. Intellect did not contrive it. Like Mohammed said of the 
		holy Koran, any who doubt the sincerity of this Chronicle should try 
		composing such commentary on their own initiative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
