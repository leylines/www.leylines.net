		<strong><em>
		<br class="auto-style101">And unto the angel of the church of the 
		Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true 
		witness, the beginning of the creation of Elohim; I know thy works, that 
		thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then, 
		because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee 
		out of my mouth. <br>
		<br>
		Because thou sayest, l am rich, and increased 
		with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art 
		wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee 
		to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white 
		raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy 
		nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou 
		mayest see.<br><br>
		As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be 
		zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: 
		if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and 
		will sup with him, and he with me.<br>
		<br>To him&nbsp;that
		<a href="yisrael.gif">overcometh</a> 
		will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and 
		am set down with my Father in his throne. Hear what the Spirit saith 
		unto the churches.
		
		</em></strong><p><span class="auto-style8">As the monk 
		approached his destination, the words of the child began repeating 
		themselves in his mind. The resonance of each repetition gained a little 
		as he walked-- as though the child's voice first matured, then merged 
		with other voices: a few, then many; and now, as he stepped into the 
		open doorway before him, more than his mind could embrace.<br class="auto-style101">
		<br class="auto-style101">
		<img height="182" src="george.gif" style="float: left; margin: 9px 13px" width="200">"No one wins. No one wins!" The significance of the words changed of 
		themselves in accompaniment with his reeling thoughts. "No one wins?" It 
		was as though a multitude were knocking at every opening that could be 
		occupied by consciousness. He paused upon the threshold a timeless 
		while, and a new voice he recognized as his own seemed to answer, "We 
		win as One."<br class="auto-style101"><br class="auto-style101">
		Light surpassing light enfolded him from within, and 
		all that he had known began to burn-- not as in the raging fires of 
		Earth, nor even as in the hidden fire of ice: the fire in which he stood 
		proceeded from itself 
		and bathed unto transformation, fusing the 
		purified essence of his former existences in time into an elevated continuation so far beyond his expectations that it appeared as new. 
		Every expression that had ever crossed his face was there before him, 
		now, revealed as but a single, smiling appearance of Maya-- Illusion: 
		his mother to this moment, and his new-found friend.<br class="auto-style101">
		<br class="auto-style101">His body was 
		being rebuilt, cell by cell. <a href="../Nod/Cain/bdellium.html">As crystals form</a>, so he grew: his feet and 
		his abdomen, new; his legs and his lungs, new; his loins and his heart, 
		new; his shoulders, arms, and his ears, new; his eyes and his hands, 
		new; his forehead and, yet again, all of him, new: and yet the same!<br class="auto-style101">
		<br class="auto-style101">An ancient writing opened to him: "Neither shalt thou go up by steps 
		unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon." His life 
		to this moment had been like steps inside a prayer wheel, whose turnings 
		had kept his place in every circumstance. He had not come to an end, nor 
		even to a new beginning, but to the center!<br class="auto-style101">
		<br class="auto-style101">He reached out his 
		arms to touch the door posts. They were there, but they were no longer 
		solid, as at his approach. They rose above him on left and right like 
		pillars of smoke. He turned his head to follow their trails upward and 
		was nearly overwhelmed by the shining of the lintel: it was as though he 
		had come face to face with eternity compacted into a single moment of 
		time.<br class="auto-style101"><br class="auto-style101">
		He might certainly have fallen, then; but the smallest of 
		all voices from him who is Least of all invited him to enter. The monk 
		would not have presumed to ask the question, but it was answered, 
		nonetheless: "I am that I am."<br class="auto-style101">
		<br class="auto-style101">On the other side, he was seated 
		in his hut, the many-petal Lotus. His prayer wheel was slowly spinning 
		in the air around him. Deer were looking in at the window, and he 
		understood that they were waiting to be fed. He stretched himself to 
		make certain of this new vision, and his hands were filled, abundantly, 
		with seed.</span></p>
