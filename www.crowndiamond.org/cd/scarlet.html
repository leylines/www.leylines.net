		The prevailing understanding is that man is a trinity, of sorts-- 
		comprised of body, soul, and spirit. This view, however, is not 
		sufficient to satisfy some difficult statements in scripture; nor is it 
		useful in learning of the righteousness of Elohim or of the destiny of 
		man; neither is it consistent with even scientific thought, which 
		generally recognizes conscious, sub-conscious, and unconscious levels of 
		mind, all of these being fed and a<span class="auto-style38">nimated by the life force-- the 
		libido, or id.</span></p>

		<span class="auto-style34">Of

		immortal by nature, according to scripture; and as spirit is the gift of&nbsp;</span><span class="auto-style68">hwhy</span><span class="auto-style34"> and 
		returns to him at physical death, one wonders how creation could serve 
		perfection of soul to mankind's benefit, or by what logic mortals could 
		deserve an eternal condemnation for failing to achieve that end. Nowhere 
		does the scripture speak of an immortal soul, though soul can put on 
		immortality, and yet there must be an immortal component to every 
		incarnation, else the reason for our trials and tribulations here, 
		below, can only be irrational-- the whim of capricious omnipotence 
		playing with pawns. When 
		our view of self is askew, can our view of Elohim be any better? 
		Misunderstanding ourselves and maligning our God, how are we to bring light to the world?</span></p>

		<img height="414" src="shekinah.gif" style="float: left; margin: 10px 15px" width="169">The great lamp that shone first in Galilee proclaimed of John the 
		Baptist, that John&nbsp;was&nbsp;Elias, while 
		John specifically said that he was&nbsp;not, and neither was he that 
		prophet. John was mistaken? This greatest of men born by woman? I think 
		not. There&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;be 
		a cohesive interpretation by which the statements of John and Y'shua are congruent; for in 
		Mashiyach were found, not yea and nay, but yea. If apparently 
		contradictory statements are found in scripture, the explanation can only be 
		that the reader has yet to come to the paradigm of 
		<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/kiss.jpg">affirmation</a>.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		Further, Y'shua said of Avraham, Yitschaq, and Yaaqov, that they are not 
		dead, and that those who see them as being dead do greatly err: among 
		whom we must also number Peter, if we judge only by the letter of his 
		words concerning the buried patriarch, King David. Again, there must be 
		a level of interpretation in which all testimony is congruent, if 
		scripture is true; and I began my study of these matters by taking hold 
		of the affirmation that <span class="auto-style69">la</span> is Father&nbsp; of the living, and by then 
		scrutinizing the New Testament scriptures most closely associated with a 
		finality of death: those dealing with blasphemy against the Holy Breath.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		I found that, according to the letter, those statements also differ 
		somewhat: Matthew says, "but whosoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it 
		shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world 
		to come." Mark says, "he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost 
		never has forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal condemnation." Luke 
		says, "but unto him that blasphemes against the Holy Ghost it shall not 
		be forgiven": never forgiven, <em>period</em>-- however one might 
		interpret Matthew's 
		world/age caveat-- but yet, according to Mark, only <em>in&nbsp;danger</em>&nbsp;of 
		eternal condemnation!</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		Many believe that only the greatest sinners are guilty of this greatest 
		sin. However, blasphemy against the Spirit of Truth is not limited to 
		vocal protestations of disbelief concerning the words of Moshe or of Yahushúa, 
		or to the misuse of holy names, or to the defilement of spirit through 
		behavior. 
		</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		The master of Torah, who judges according to inward thought, taught 
		that "Whenever you have done this unto one of these, the least of my 
		servants, you have done it unto me"; for "Him that receives you receives 
		me, and him that receives me receives him who sent me." Argued 
		differently, to offend in one point is to risk being guilty of all. Sin 
		is error, and error has been a constant in my natural life, and in my 
		spiritual life as well. I'm guilty, without doubt; but whether I'm 
		therefore condemned is another matter.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		We're all on the block; for we all have ignorantly blasphemed the Lord 
		of Glory in our midst by some cutting remark or some deed that warred 
		against the spirit of a friend. We all, at one time or another in our lives, have 
		called the truth a lie and have rejected its messengers, thus crucifying 
		Truth in unbelief. One might claim that the sin of blasphemy can only be 
		committed willfully, purposefully; but-- willful or not-- it has the 
		same effects in the lives of those who commit it carelessly, ignorantly: 
		it prevents them from nourishment of the Truth; and it blocks access 
		to Truth for those upon they have influence, as well. Far from being a rare sin, 
		blasphemy against the Spirit of the Holy is a common sin. Indeed, it was 
		the first sin.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		Realizing I was vulnerable to the ultimate condemnation (we must live by
		<em>every</em> word), I recalled 
		Ezekiel's saying: "The soul that sins, it 
		shall die": an unequivocal statement! To what, then, does salvation 
		pertain, since all have sinned and since all sinning souls are under an 
		unequivocal sentence of death? We believe that the wages of sin are 
		superseded by the gift of Life to those who walk in faith; but how are we to 
		receive this gift, since we have all characterized Truth as falsehood at 
		some time in our lives, our souls thus falling forfeit to the most solemn 
		judgment?</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		The Father's words in the mouth of the Son are, "Unless you believe that 
		I AM, you shall die in your sins." Well, belief is the gateway to 
		ransom, but not of sinful souls; for by the word of no small prophet, 
		sinners are under an unequivocal 
		sentence of death! Yes, when we receive of the Father's Life in the Son, we 
		become not reformed or realigned souls, but new creatures: we walk in 
		the newness of the Father's life, and not as reformed sinners. However-- 
		more troublesome, yet: the new creature Paul (or him speaking through 
		apostle Shaul) characterized himself as the foremost/first/chief sinner! Where, 
		then, lies the hope of men living less careful lives? For it is written, 
		"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in 
		us."</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		In answer to these questions, I turned to the words, "He that overcomes 
		shall not be hurt of the second death." This scripture did not fully 
		answer my concerns, but it became very like a lifeline, pulling my mind 
		through the inquiry. Some hold that the first death is a child's physical birth-- 
		its incarnation into flesh; others see the first death as the spiritual 
		end of the man of 
		sin, that the child of light can be born. Although both views have merit 
		for certain lines of inquiry, I believed, from my youth, that the second 
		death could be none other than the death of the sinful soul, subsequent to the 
		death of the physical body: for it is given unto man once to die, and 
		after that the judgment. Note that the scripture does not say that those 
		who overcome shall <em>escape</em> the second death, but that they shall not be 
		<em>hurt</em> of it, by it.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		I believe that the atonement for sin that comes by the voluntary 
		shedding of the lifeblood of him who knew no sin provided a scarlet 
		thread by which we can escape the overthrow of perdition: that this 
		atonement makes possible the&nbsp;process&nbsp;of 
		salvation, bringing us near the congregation of <a href="yisrael.html">Y'Shar<span class="auto-style69">al</span></a> for the purpose 
		of perfection. Strangers no longer, we can drink of the Living Waters 
		apportioned to God's Children, escaping the fate of the old man-- the karmic husk that 
		clings to the threads of true Life, hoping for atonement. No longer the 
		prime mover, the old man continues his grumbling in subservient 
		sacrifice to the authority of the Life now found in the New Man, the 
		Son of Man, the Complete Adam. Twins operating under the dictums of two 
		laws are struggling to the birth in the wombs of our tabernacles; and 
		they are either empowered or shackled by our choices in the Spirit.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		Atonement (at-One-ment) pertains to receiving the spirit of 
		adoption, the fruition of which is the redemption of the celestial body 
		(not of the sinful soul, which must die; nor of the physical body, 
		because flesh and blood cannot inherit). The book of Romans testifies 
		that we are, simultaneous to spiritual adoption,&nbsp;<em>already</em>&nbsp;the 
		children of Elohim by an immaculate conception through the Holy Spirit&nbsp;(1 
		Cor. 4:15; Mt. 23:9). We agree with the apostles, 
		therefore, that salvation is an ongoing birth process that must be 
		worked out in our natural lives, and that the manifestation of the sons 
		of HaShem has yet to appear in its fullness because they are yet 
		encumbered by the karmic swaddling clothes of the sinner: the fullness 
		of the Light in them is yet 
		hidden in this age of worldly dominance, this third measure of 
		meal.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		We share Serai's triumphal laughter at the promise of a child in her old 
		age; for what can be the mother of this holy child promised to each of 
		us, other than our own, old and imperfect souls? For that which is born of the 
		Spirit is spirit, while that which is born of the flesh is flesh. Soul is the medium in which spirit and flesh interface: 
		the mortal soul is the body 
		formed by the Breath of Spirit, and it monitors and 
		integrates the sentient faculties of the flesh.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		As living souls that walk upon the path of atonement, we take up our crosses 
		daily and crucify the old man on them, that the new man might live in 
		us. What is the old man, other than the sinful soul? What is the new 
		man, other than the <em>developing</em> soul of the new creature? By following in 
		the footsteps of HaMashiyach, we work out our salvation by faith, 
		sharing the interest accrued on the wages of sin. Men of spots and 
		blemishes could never pay the debt; but the teachings of sowing and 
		reaping make it clear that there is <em>somewhat</em> to repay, and that the walk 
		in Messiah is the narrow path to Life in new garments that must be <em>
		purchased</em>, if we are to come to a balancing of accounts. Thus it is 
		written of the thieves destined for&nbsp; their places at Golgotha, that 
		if the Anointed of Yah shall make us free, we are free indeed.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		The holy, embryonic child we carry in the 
		temple of our bodies is wrapped in swaddling clothes-- in the convulsive 
		garments of the soul of the old man&nbsp;(Lk. 
		17:34). Are we not instructed that a woman will be saved-- not hurt of 
		the second death-- if she continue in child bearing? Let us not lose 
		hope, therefore. The travail of Y'Shar<span class="auto-style69">al</span> 
		within the wilderness is long and 
		difficult because of sin, but HaShem promised that he is able to bring 
		us to the birth-- but again, each in his order.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		Brothers are for adversity.
		Our zeal for the new man being born in us makes us ashamed of the 
		swaddling garments belonging to the old man; and the temptation is to 
		deny them, to conceal them, to suppress them. This is not the denial of 
		self of which the scriptures speak; for he who would save his life will 
		lose it. This kind of denial is the pitfall of hypocrisy; and it aborts the 
		processes of birth. Yet further, to expect our spirits to kill the old 
		man through denial is to embrace the processes of 
		death-- to become whited sepulchers; for we have somewhat to repay for 
		the bones buried in the past, and we cannot enter into freedom until 
		the last farthing is paid. Denial of self is without caveat and must 
		answer to the visceral witness of the Indwelling: we must abdicate 
		enthronement of our wills to the will of HaShem, so much as is possible 
		at every moment in every circumstance.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		The old man in us is broke. The only thing he can offer for errors of 
		the past is recognition of guilt. It's the new man who must pay, by 
		purchasing of Messiah new garments through our service in his steps, 
		that our nakedness not be revealed. This is understanding is good and 
		very good; for it is the garments of the 
		sinners we have been that determine the mission fields that will be 
		expedient, through our service, for what we are becoming: both for working out individual perfection and for the 
		efficacious spreading of the good news of the Kingdom of Heaven unto all 
		peoples, everywhere.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		The apostle Shaul speaks of the two laws of sin and of grace operating 
		simultaneously within himself. The intersection of these laws is the 
		essence of the cross: by a narrow focus on their interactions, we 
		witness-- step by step, in our lives-- the righteousness that is ours 
		through the second Adam as it victoriously confronts and cancels the 
		unrighteousness that entered by the first: the triumphs of each 
		day contribute to the maturation of the new creature unto its state of 
		perfection, due upon the last day. As the dynamics of the cross operate within us, bodily, the 
		intersection of these two laws bring us into alignment with the 
		measurement of the Godhead that is in Messiah.</p>
		<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;" class="auto-style38">
		These two laws-- one pertaining to the old man, and the other, to the 
		new-- are as the sons (words, works, formulations) of 
		<a href="../Matthew/7Judas.html">Yahúdah</a> (praise) 
		by <a href="../Matthew/10Thamar.html">Tamar</a> (uplifted-ness): they are as 
		<a href="../Matthew/9Zara.html">Zerach</a> (the arising) being 
		supplanted at birth by <a href="../Matthew/8Phares.html">Perets</a> (the breach). These two sons war together in the

		The appearance of the finger of Zerach is as the first sign/wonder of 
		our experience of salvation. When Zerach is withdrawn back into the

		soul comprising the old man; for only after full presentation of the 
		parameters of Perets-- of the breach-- can Zerach be freed to take his 
		place in the lineage of&nbsp; <a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shua</a>: all debts 
		having been paid; every accuser, cast down;

		At physical death, the body returns to the grave of earth, where there 
		is no understanding; the spirit returns to HaShem, who gave it; and the 
		soul-- if it is counted as worthy-- is not hurt of the second death: 
		does not go backwards, forced to relearn painful lessons of the past. This 
		understanding means that the 
		second death for those who have, to great measure, overcome is a change for purpose of 
		extension: not an end, a termination.</p>

		But what, then, of the fathers to whom the promises pertain who died owing 
		wages of sin? For of them, as also of us, it is written, "There is none

		unrighteousness, are they now living in a purgatorial Sheol or Gehennah? 
		If so, are we to understand Avraham's bosom to be a kind of hell! 
		Further, the "good" thief on the cross, with little to recommend 
		him, was promised paradise on the day of his physical death. We can 
		argue that the 
		thief died after the cross and the patriarchs before; but the Lamb of 
		<a href="God.html">Elohim</a> was slain&nbsp;from the foundations of the world; 
		and <a href="../Matthew/3Abraham.html">Avraham</a> and those with him are clearly pictured in the gospels as 
		residing in paradise previous to the temporal cross.</p>

		There is a higher interpretation of the patriarchal functions than can

		and life must have their effects at every level of interpretation, in 
		harmony with the extension capabilities of the Crown Diamond display and 
		the developmental levels of God's children and the words, "in him was 
		yea and nay, but yea." Spiritual land is promised to Avraham's seed and to Avraham,&nbsp;himself. By what 
		means, then, does he inherit it?</p>

		This is what I understand concerning man: the body is the outer garment; 
		the soul is the inner garment; the angel is that which is clothed; and 
		the spirit that proceeds from the Father is the life and the unity of 
		the entire organism. It is given man once to die. Take away any one of 
		these elements, and man is no longer man: he becomes a disunity, with 
		his constituent parts being extended to their realms, or localities, of 
		origin-- with them being gathered to their fathers.</p>

		In fact, there is no death; there is only extension from one form to 
		another, as also from one state of being to another. The natural law of 
		the conservation of energy should settle that question, even for 
		non-believers. If thought is electrical impulses carried in the nervous 
		system, it cannot be lost; it can only change. Look for death: where is 
		it? It is the misperception of man! Even a natural corpse is full of life, 
		though the life of man is absent. Death is extension, and the questions 
		it raises have relevance only as they teach us about life.</p>

		second death, given that every soul that sins must die? The second death, if such were the case, would be 
		universal oblivion! The core of our being, on Earth as it is in heaven,

		The angel is the first formulation of Spirit. It is naked fire. 
		Delineated as a spark within the consuming fire of HaShem, the angel 
		seeks a house capable of withstanding its fire; but it is incapable, on its own, of inhabiting 
		a body without 
		causing its ultimate dissolution by burning it up. The angel is a pillar 
		of fire, a tongue of fire, a worm of fire. It achieves stability only 
		when positioned in a lamp. As the natural element of the angelic, "worm" 
		is a fitting metaphor for fire; for it is all slopes-- all&nbsp;<em>eshdat</em>-- 
		"the manner of fire." It climbs tentatively, it burrows, it consumes its 
		path. Divided, it is cloned. Water, in its free state, is its natural 
		peril. Knowing this to be true, the angels therefore rejoiced at the 
		creation of Earth, and of mankind, upon it. </p>

		When the angel incarnates in a <a href="worm.html">cocoon</a> of 
		flesh, the soul's life and its end commences with the body's first breath; however, 
		the soul's life at birth is but the beginning of a process of 
		transformations that will lead to eternal Life. The destiny is certain, but 
		the stages along the way depend upon the soul's progress in the will of&nbsp;<span class="auto-style71">hwhy</span>. 
		When that which is perfect is come, imperfect stages fall away. We 
		have a foretaste of this truth even now, as we daily mature, stage by 
		stage, walking in Y'shua's footsteps towards perfection.</p>
