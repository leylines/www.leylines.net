		<span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Before the spies from the green tree crossed over into 
		Canaan to survey the land, they were already in possession of the good report that came by Moshe. The half stick belonging to the dry tree is also in possession of a good report-- that which came by John the Revelator from Yahushua, in the message to the 
	Churches of Asia. Looking backward to Jordan's ancient crossings and forward, through the crossings of our day and on to the future, great crossing in the time of the Deliverer, we are able to discern 
		<a href="howl.html">the ten evil reports</a> of the fearful spies, presented in the previous text on the Canaanites. Two reports are still needed: the reports of Oshea/Osee (<a href="selah.html">Hoseah,
		<span class="auto-style68">ocwh</span></a>), also called both Joshua (Y'shúa,
		<span class="auto-style68">ocwhy</span>) and Jehoshua (Yahushúa, 
		</span><span class="auto-style68">owcwhy</span><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">), and 
	Caleb's report, as well.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">We will therefore spy out the land of Canaan twice again before we prepare to take 
	a better-informed possession. Each time, we will embark from Malkuth; but to reconstruct Joshua's report, we will take the right-hand path; and for Caleb's, the left. We adopt this procedure because 
	Truth and Grace, garments of the center 
		path, were hidden within the deep mysteries of Torah in the time of the Fathers and were fully comprehended by few, as it is therefore written 
	of the <a href="selah.html">battle of Jericho</a>, "Nay, but as captain of the host of
		<span class="auto-style68">hwhy</span> am I now come." This thirteenth spy must speak again, as concerns the 
	Churches of Asia.</span></p><p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">I had no intention of taking the narrative in this direction, having planned quite another; but the Holy Spirit drew my mind this way as I began to work out my conception of the text's next turn. As I considered the implications of the new instruction I was receiving, I soon passed the limits of conventional approaches to scripture. I 
	left behind, also, my own understanding of appropriate applications of Adam Kadmon for study: I was proposing, in effect, to use the symbol to recapture the purport of unrecorded conversations,&nbsp;some thousands of years in the past. Should I be blessed in the undertaking, how could I defend 
	the fruit against criticism? 
	I suppose there may always be a thin line between revelation and the work of speculative imagination.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Who would receive it? Could I believe it myself? If the teaching it engendered should be judged as essentially true by witness of the Holy Spirit, how could that truth be presented in a way that would not offend-- either as written by me, or as 
	shared with another by any reader who might receive 
	authenticating witness? What use could it be, therefore? </span></p>
	<p class="auto-style73">
	<span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">At the very outset, I would have to make unsupportable assumptions about Caleb and Joshua. How, then, might the end stand scrutiny? As I prepare this 
	final edition in preparation for an attempt at finishing the 
	<a href="../Nod/Garden/pp10.html">Chronicles of Nod</a>, I still don't know; but I 
	will continue by the counsel I first received: if a door is opened, I ought 
	to go through it. I believe in the ongoing work of the Spirit of Truth. I have come, also, to trust the words of Paul: "For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?"</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">My best advice to readers is to free yourselves of the force of my logic, such as it is, and to ask the Father directly if all this is worth your while. I'll hold no grudge-- as I, myself, have but a vague idea of the purpose of what follows 
	and shall follow. Fair is fair. I have explained my instructions as they were given, and I've got a job to do. Another door has been opened; and I, for one, have learned wisdom enough to step on through to the other side, even in 
	confirmation of my foolishness.</span></p><p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">We will associate Caleb with the Messianic line of Judah. There is no serious trouble there, even though Caleb's father was a Kenizzite, 
	either according to the flesh or by reason of the location of his house. Joshua, as minister to Moses, we will associate with Levi, the priestly line. True, Oshea 
	was a son of Ephrayim; but he came to serve in new names at the side of Moses, whom we identify as forerunner of Y'shúa in the line of Melchizedek.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">
		In the context of these associations, we recall the image of Hur 
		(representing Caleb as a son of Judah), Moses, and Joshua at the battle 
		of Rephaims in the vicinity of Horeb, between Y'Shar</span><span class="auto-style76">al</span><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;"> 
		and the Amalekites. The beginning of significant difficulty is that we 
		will place Hur, as also Caleb, on the left of Moses; while Joshua, we'll 
		settle on the right.</span></p><p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Left and right are matters of perspective. As we consider Adam Kadmon, for example, are we looking out from our 
	own vantage point, or are we seeing as from above-- from a heavenly perspective-- and looking back towards our seeing selves? Even more complex, is Messiah looking at us face-to-face, as 
	Jehoshua with Moses in the closet of his tent; or has he covered our eyes with 
	his hand, as upon Sinai, that we may follow, as from behind? As he turns, do the sephiroth 
	swivel also? All of them? These questions of right and left are matters of routine in our daily lives; but should the familiar 
	interplay be suspended 
	in this context, as they shall briefly be by this presentation, the implications go somewhat beyond protocol.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style73"><span style="font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, times;">Brushing all that aside, however, we will follow first Caleb, then Joshua, as they enter Canaan at the place called Malkuth. We shall imagine that 
	all spies branched out-- not unreasonable, as a group of twelve would have 
	been rather conspicuous without some extensive subterfuge, and because Joshua, himself, later sent out spies as a mere pair, even as Y'shúa sent the twelve by twos, and as every 
	human pairs within himself the earthly and the heavenly man. We will postulate that Caleb went to the left after crossing Jordan, and that Joshua went 
	to the right. If others went straight on to branch out elsewhere, their evil reports brought no promise of positive revelation to add to our understanding; so we will not concern ourselves with that probability.</span></p>
