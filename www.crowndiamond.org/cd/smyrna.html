		<p class="auto-style122"><em>&nbsp;And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things 
		saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; I know thy 
		works, and tribulation, and poverty (but thou art rich), and I know the 
		blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the 
		synagogue of Satan.<br>
		<br>Fear none of those things which thou shalt

		let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that 
		<a href="yisrael.gif">overcometh</a> shall not be hurt of the second death.</em></p>
		<p class="auto-style8">
		</strong>The location in the flesh of the church at Smyrna 
		is not so apparent as for the church at Ephesus; it is inferred from the 
		text of other messages to the churches of Asia by searching this way a 
		little and that way a little-- in scripture, in the flesh, in experience 
		in the Spirit, and in the traditions of kabbalah. As pertains to the 
		first Adam, I found Smyrna to be symbolic of the abdominal region. "If 
		any man lack wisdom, let him ask Elohénu, who giveth to all men 
		liberally and upbraideth not." The fullness of the stature of 
		<a href="../Matthew/matthew1.html">Messiah Yahushúa</a> comes in the unity of the faith by the aggregation of 
		affirmations.<br><br>
		Malkuth is often signified by the key words 
		"stones" and "Rock," as used in the King James version of "The Book." 
		The order of authority in the Kingdom of Elohim is conveyed by such 
		words in Yahushúa's teaching to Peter about the keys to the Kingdom: 
		"Cephas" (Kepa/), Peter's Hebrew name, means "hollow rock" or "stone"; 
		the name "Peter" (Petros) means "rock": larger than a stone, but 
		connoting a piece of a larger rock. The word for "Rock" (petra) means 
		"massive boulder," suggesting the mass from which the "petros" was 
		extracted. We therefore say that the keys to the Kingdom are in this 
		understanding: "A little, hollow stone can become a rock, but the 
		Boulder is boss upon the Mountain of Elohim."<br>
		<br>Yesod, or 
		Foundation, also has its key words in the King James, among them "reins" 
		and "foundation." The abdomen, as traditional location of the reins, is 
		also the location of the beginning of life-- of its foundational 
		moments-- in human reproduction. Not only is the abdomen the general 
		location of the mother's womb: the egg, having been fertilized and 
		beginning to divide and multiply, is transformed into the new tabernacle 
		of flesh by means of the navel.<br>
		<br>When the body has been formed and 
		emerges as a whole organism, furthermore, it is the functions of the 
		reins that predominate the early, foundational days of the child's 
		life-- the taking of nourishment and the elimination of wastes. As life 
		continues, the faculties of the reins extend their foundational 
		functions under the influence of other faculties-- the appetites 
		broadening beyond their basic attachments, to lead the organism into one 
		activity for growth and another for balance, and so forth.<br>
		<br>It is 
		significant that the spheres Malkuth and Yesod are located on the same 
		path line, the center path: the relationship of the two is both 
		sequential and uniquely direct. In Malkuth the bride and groom are 
		united; in Yesod are unveiled the parameters of the partnership: the 
		progression is from faith during espousal and exchange of vows to 
		knowledge of the significance of unification upon consummation of the 
		marriage.<br><br>
		In addressing the angel of the church at Smyrna, 
		Yahushúa confirms at once his identity and authority and proceeds with a 
		message containing no rebuke, but only words of encouragement, recalling 
		the image of the bridegroom preparing his bride for the long walk they 
		will share together. It is not that there remains no more to be 
		overcome, as the crown of life (Kether) has yet to be bestowed. There is 
		yet reason for rebuke, which is indeed forthcoming in the next message 
		to the churches; but in Yesod, Yahushúa is busy strengthening trust, or 
		faith, and laying a foundational understanding for the trials yet to 
		come on the path to spiritual maturation.<br>
		<br>
		<img height="182" src="cit.sm2y.gif" style="float: left; margin: 8px 14px" width="200">The proper foundation 
		is laid by removing things movable and coming to bedrock. Spiritually, 
		this is achieved by affliction of soul-- by digging deep in relentless 
		examination of self to discover what is superfluous in one's life-- 
		those things that are contrary to the measurement of Messiah. This work 
		is full of tribulation, and its immediate end is a sense of 
		impoverishment at having shed physical, emotional, and psychological 
		frills and dainties. The loss of the various forms of the mammon of 
		unrighteousness, however, shall be compensated by ten-fold gain of 
		righteous mammon-- of enduring treasure, both now and in the life to 
		come.<br><br>
		As one nears freedom from vanity, however, he is distracted 
		by the realization that not all who are nominally walking the same path 
		are making the same sacrifices. This realization is a great stumbling 
		block, moving focus from the motes remaining in one's own eye to the 
		beams in the eyes of others; and a dual focus, 
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shúa</a> taught in his 
		ministry upon Earth, is the beginning of great darkness that only seems 
		as light. <a href="../Matthew/Matthew2.html">Yahushúa</a> affirms progress and redirects the mind of the angel 
		at Smyrna precisely to that focus of faith which will consecrate its 
		travail unto fruition.<br>
		<p class="auto-style8">The devil, that fallen angel of the carnal 
		mind, will cast some who have progressed thus far into prison for trial 
		and tribulation lasting ten days: he will sift them into portions to try 
		their purity. If the ten spheres, or sephiroth, are symbolic of stages 
		or levels or days of spiritual reality, it is likely that every pilgrim 
		will either pass through them or become entrapped within them.<br>
		<br>
		Those who wrestle with the realities of the spheres are as those apt to 
		become imprisoned within them. These will have tribulation; for their 
		focus is not perfectly Messiah himself, but the garments of 
		<a href="../Matthew/4mashiyach.html">Messiah</a>-- 
		the doctrines and righteous mammon of spiritual strengths with which the 
		Father has clothed him. This focus upon garments is a way that seems 
		right to many; but its end is, mercifully, destruction that culminates 
		not in annihilation, but in restoration of proper focus by the paring 
		away of error.<br>
		<br>Iniquity in the Body operates in a mystery. We are 
		not called to serve forms, even if they be the highest forms, but to 
		serve the Spirit of Elohim, the Living Principles from whence forms 
		flow. Perhaps yet another metaphor will make the point clearer: 
		doctrines are not principles, though they easily appear so from our 
		perspectives below, but are as the winds stirred by Principle as it 
		moves against the shifting sands of human values and mutable states of 
		being. We enter into the Father's rest as we come to know the still, 
		small, inward voice that wars against all turbulence.<br>
		<br>The ways of 
		Principle are not somewhat higher than the ways of forms; they are 
		vastly higher. Heaven and Earth-- the context in which we presently 
		interpret the written Word and by which we understand the 
		Living Word <em>as</em> made flesh in the ministry of Y'shúa-- 
		will pass away; but the Projected Word of Y<span class="auto-style145">H</span> will endure unto eternity, being eternally reinterpreted by 
		forms according to their experience of the transforming revelations of 
		Principle.<br><br>
		In the week ordained by Messiah from the beginning, 
		there are not ten days, but seven-- seven appearances of one light. 
		Similarly, there are seven churches of Asia-- of one continent-- not 
		ten. The countenance of Messiah is as the sun, whose power supplants or 
		greatly diminishes lesser lights ordained for mercy in periods of 
		darkness. As children of the Light, we are not permitted to focus 
		forever on the lesser lights; for we, ourselves, have been kindled by 
		enlightenment.<br>
		<br>Proper focus on the Single Light of Elohim moves 
		us upward in Adam Kadmon not through ten levels, but through seven-- as 
		three levels are lighted, as it were, by binary stars. At no level are 
		we to become enamored with the angels, or lights, residing therein. If 
		we should find ourselves encumbered by multiple focuses on lesser 
		lights, the message to Ephesus would still apply: "Nevertheless I have 
		somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love."<br>
		<br>
		When we are lighted by the Light of Messiah, every bowl and knop of the 
		Menorah-- of the human tabernacle as the Body of Messiah-- is revealed 
		as being lighted by that one Light: the prayer is that we may be One! As 
		we lift Messiah up from the Earth in our members, we become the city set 
		upon the hill: not only is the single Light that is in each of us 
		visible to all, but it is also incapable of being hidden-- by bushels 
		(measures used in commerce), by powers and principalities, or by any 
		such thing. The Light of God's Son shines outwardly and inwardly, 
		exposing all things to our understanding in accordance with our needs, 
		whether they be the hidden thoughts of men or the hidden things of 
		progressive levels of spiritual reality.<br>
		<br>We proceed not by 
		contemplation of such holy mammon as doctrines, nor by mastery of 
		mysteries or of sephiroth, but by continuing to seek first the Kingdom 
		of Elohim and his righteousness: his Light, whereupon all these things 
		shall be added unto us. It is our discipline only to order our minds 
		correctly, giving glory to Principle for all things, that we shall be 
		prepared to walk without offense in the many garments with which we 
		shall be clothed in the eons of eternity.<br>
		<br>That our spirits and 
		their angels shall be so clothed is conveyed in the promise, "He that 
		overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death"; for we know both 
		that, "He that believeth on me hath everlasting life," already (one can 
		truly and fervently believe while still vulnerable to sin, and those so 
		coming unto the Son shall in no wise be cast out), and that, "The soul 
		that sinneth, it shall die." Eternal life does not depend upon 
		perfection; eternal identity does. Praise the Holy Name!</p>
