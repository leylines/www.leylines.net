		The Howl of Palestinia</span></h1>
<h1 class="auto-style90">Jihad: the Battle Within</h1>
		<p class="auto-style103">When HaShem gave the promises to father Abraham and to his seed, the lands occupied by ten nations were promised. </p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
Because Torah is spiritual, we understand that its promised "lands" aren't 
parcels of real estate. Rather, they are metaphorical references to the body's physical structures, 
which house the faculties of life within the human tabernacle.</p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		The spiritual faculties of man are seated within the organic boundaries 
		of the physical body's organisms. We acknowledge this when we speak of 
		the heart, mind, emotions, and so forth, which is the reason it is 
		taught that the Kingdom of Heaven is within you. That great treasure is 
		housed in earthen vessels until perfection comes upon us, when mortality 
		shall put on immortality as the New Jerusalem descends upon us from 
		above.</p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		The challenge and the promise, then, is that the spiritual mind must take precedence over the carnal mind, suffusing the body with the Light of HaShem, 
		that the new creature may attain its maturity in Mashiyach, thereby manifesting Y'Shar<span class="auto-style102">la</span>. 
		To that end, we are called to leave all personal Earth-bound trials behind, 
		that we can be free to take up the path to Golgotha unencumbered by the 
		cares of the world. </p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		To walk that path in the footsteps of Y'shua is to enter into the pagent 
		of the exodus from Egypt in the company of Moses and the rest; for the 
		path plays out in the wilderness of Gethsemene, where we will face the 
		dark night of the soul, wrestling with God as did Jacob at Beth-El. 
		These trials are given that we might resolve unsettled matters, 
		purchasing new garments for the new creature by toiling in the Father's 
		soul fields. The dust of the ground carries the Father's curse, which is 
		lifted from the new creature as the grace of gentle Immanu<span class="auto-style102">al</span> 
		is imbued with Power from on high. Resting in the Father, we find that 
		we are 
prepared to walk the path of the masters, furnished to all good works; for it is 
		not we who speak or do anything, but the Power of God in us.</p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		Jihad has nothing to do with any exterior consideration. It is fought 
		within through interactions with others who are fighting their own 
		battles. Brothers are for adversity. They clash, bringing their 
		strengths to points of contention. If one insists upon having the 
		advantage, that one is Cain. Unloving aggression may seem to have 
		advantage for a season, but the real strength belongs to the one willing 
		to risk his life by engaging a brother's demons, that the Salvation of 
		God might spread throughout the earth. </p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		&nbsp;Yes, there is that which must perish in each of us. King Saul might 
		killl his thousands, but the foes keep replenishing themselves. David 
		kills his tens of thousands: not by sword and axe, but by circumcision. 
		He mines Palestinia for new recruits, knowing there is one law for all. </p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		The beatitudes of Saint Matthew are as the blessings shouted from
		<a href="Sermon.1.html">Mount Gerizim</a>. The howl of the Philistines 
		is filled with the curses of <a href="falling.html">Mount Ebal</a>. 
		Hopefully, these words will clarify the distinction; for the 
		characteristics of the ten nations 
	of Canaan, whose people share the sordid life dynamics with which we are all familiar, are implicit in the Sephiroth as follows:</p>

		<span class="auto-style88">The Canaanites are, literally, "those who turn the back." Children of Cain through 
		<a href="file:///C:/Users/bfint/Documents/crowndiamond.org/Nod/Noah/Ham.html">Cham/Ham</a>, meaning "heat," they live under the curse decreed for their good by
		<a href="file:///C:/Users/bfint/Documents/crowndiamond.org/Nod/Noah/Noah.html">Noah/Noach</a>, meaning "the will to arise, to be elevated,

		<a href="file:///C:/Users/bfint/Documents/crowndiamond.org/Nod/Noah/Shem.html">Shem</a> (in the tabernacle of the Name).</span><br class="auto-style88">
	<br class="auto-style88"><span class="auto-style88">As a result of Noah's curse, the rashness of 
		Ham, their patriarch, is tempered by the blessing of shame, for their good. Noah's prophecy concerning the service of Cham's progeny to Yapeth and Shem is reason for caution against judging the Canaanites uncharitably, if other caution against judgment should be thought not to apply.</span><br class="auto-style88">
	<br class="auto-style88"><span class="auto-style88">In their occupation of 
		the sphere of intelligence in Adam Kadmon, it is understood that the 
		Canaanites are unwilling to apply their minds for enlightenment: they 
		turn their backs to it, either actively or passively. They prefer, as it 
		were, the slavery of Mitzraim. They are more comfortable with 
	the iron-clad definitions and the specified and regulated boundaries of Egypt 
		than with the struggles towards liberty that come only by crossing the fearsome Sea of Reeds into an arid wilderness of questionings, with its unknowns and its apparent scarcities and hardships.</span><br class="auto-style88">
	<br class="auto-style88"><span class="auto-style88">The Red Sea, sometimes called the "Sea of Rods," signifies commitment to put an end to all faulty expressions, 
		at the risk of great physical discomfort and possible death, by confronting 
		the dilemmas that come with living as a spiritual creature within a fleshly shell. 
		This, the Canaanites fear to do. Without faith in the elevating power of Elohim in their lives, the Canaanites perpetually submit themselves to the status quo. They are "sensible," according to the wisdom of the world, by the operations of an alienated spirit.</span></p>

	Unwilling by nature to explore things above at the peril of things below, the Canaanites turn their attention wholeheartedly to the 
		cares of this world. The Kenizzite branches of the family of Cain's spiritual descendants are "hunters," literally. 
		With mercy far from their hearts, their vision remains fixed upon the prey 
		that fits their appetites, ever searching. </p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		To the Kenizzite, everything is a commodity. To them, life is a series 
		of tradeoffs, and in everyy exchange, they must come out on top. They 
		will have their way! Whether in the context of business, sport, personal 
		relationships, or the hunter's blind, they'll do what it takes to meet 
		their objectives. If another has what they fancy, they're relentlessly alert for ways of attaining it. Their 
		ravenous hunger compels them to hunt without compassion; for they are 
		obsessed with the imprisoning context of their own thoughts and 
		appetites, and they are capable of mourning only for themselves, should misadventure 
		arise.</p>

		As the Kenizzite hunters of the land of Canaan become proficient providers, they conceive of extending the application of their skills: they become Kenites. 
		They believe that their exceptionalism provides a service humanity would 
		not have without their own, personal sacrifice, the risks they take 
		while investing their special skills to satisfy their agenda. The 
		buffalo, the forest, the widow's house? Nothing can be permitted to 
		stand in the way, because their work puts food on the table, after all 
		is said and done.</p>
		<p class="auto-style103">
		&nbsp;Ultimately, therefore, the Kenites begin to practice the arts of death upon their fellow men. 
		They become specialized "warriors," 
		which is a literal meaning of the tribal name. Kenites exalt their imagined needs for survival and success into the dimensions of 
		intentional warfare, hoping to annihilate competition and to establish their 
		"brand" as the territorial standard in the "lands"-- in the areas of endeavor-- they see as belonging exclusively to them. They 
		comprehend need; they understand the cycles of supply and demand, and 
		they act. Meekness is far from their hearts.</p>

<span class="auto-style88">Dividing the world into camps of "us" and "them," the 
		Kadmonites are, literally, "ancestor worshippers," in one of the more negative constructions 
		of the name's meanings. They take it upon themselves to consolidate the spoil won by their 
		more aggressive brethren and lay it up for posterity. Serving the 
		manifest destiny they learned from forebearers, they actively begin to covet and to target what is expedient for enriching and proliferating the temporal welfare of 
		all things they 
		"own." Their most important possession, of course, is their own lineage, whether 
		of bloodline or of ideology.</span><br class="auto-style88">
<br class="auto-style88"><span class="auto-style88">Thus, the Kadmonites 
		take upon themselves the function of a profaned priesthood. They begin to define 
		and enforce common-man values that are contrary to the will of HaShem, 
		which is that the familly of man live as a holy Unity. Their minds are 
		trained to serve the needs of their physical lives, and any who suggest 
		that the body's purpose is to serve the mind are treated as dangers to 
		society. Hence, as their most successful endeavors are bested by time, 
		their dynasties and empires grow old; and they crumble by force of an inner vacuum. 
		The Kadmonites are not filled by their ever-growing hunger for survival and its accompanying 
		readiness to spill 
		innocent blood. Love, mercy? The games of children!</span></p>

In times of relative peace, when weapons of war are withdrawn into the dimension of threat against any future disruption of Canaanite priorities, the Hittite terrorism also relaxes into the realm of oratory, wherein that strange elohim of fear-- the hierophant-- becomes the demon by which they enforce their wills and proliferate their values. If mercy is seen at all in their actions, it is used only to bind their victims more securely to fear of the Canaanite peoples and their ideals, in the pitiful drama of "good cop, bad cop."</p>

		They see themselves as owning their language and are jealous of any who 
		would war against dogma with conversation laden with suggestive 
		connotations. Their vanity becomes their prison because it isolates them from the potential for change that comes by honest interaction with those having differing points of view. The heart of the Perizzite is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Who can know it? Its core is hidden within a maze of unrealities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
