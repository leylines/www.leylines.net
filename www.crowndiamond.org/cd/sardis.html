		<span class="auto-style2">The small, but full, brown pea rolled out of 
		the prayer wheel's open gate, from the right towards the left, and 
		stopped a little distance away from its cage, directly beneath the 
		sleeping man. Its embryo was not damaged in the least.</span></span><span class="auto-style143"><span class="auto-style2"><br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">It was thankful 
		for this sign of health; for it had much work to do before the morning 
		and would need all its strength. It must grow to full maturity within 
		the man and multiply exceedingly; for tomorrow was a day the man would 
		walk among the people. His every word and deed would be judged by the 
		Watchers according to their proofs of this, his night's work.<br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">The man's mind 
		would be the seed's sunlight; his life experience would be its soil; and 
		it would drink of the man's reservoirs of compassion. Every seed knows 
		the parable of the sower, and this seed knew it would survive the night 
		to grow in beauty and in strength: the light in the man was bright; his 
		soil, rich; and his compassion, deep. The collective memory of the 
		seed's kind was clear in its understanding, and it was content that he 
		could follow his ancestors' best example. The Vine would be well served 
		by morning.</span></span></p>
		<p style="font-size: xx-small" class="auto-style142">
		<span class="auto-style2">The light in many men is weak because they 
		imagine many centers in which to focus their souls' energies. They 
		wonder whether they should focus their consciousness upon or against a 
		thing, or whether they should be in fear or in hope concerning any 
		development that might occur. The ancients Aharon and Moshe had warned 
		of the folly of this manner of focus; but a later king had sorely tested 
		the people by fashioning convincing images of aspects of the True Light 
		and placing them far apart, one from the other. Confusion followed. </span><span class="auto-style143">
		<span class="auto-style2"><br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">
		<img height="182" src="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/cit.sar2.gif" style="margin: 4px 13px; float: left;" width="200">The distance 
		between these images and the true image of the Light at Jerusalem made 
		it difficult for the people to see how the lesser lights were lacking in 
		comparison with the True. The idols of judgment and of mercy could never 
		convey the unity of the Elohim of judgment and mercy.<br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">The people were 
		careless in their life before such calves of fire; and so, they were 
		deceived, and their lives became vain. They would build a while at this 
		center, then at another; then they would abandon their labors entirely 
		for uncertain lengths of time, only to build anew at yet some other 
		unsuitable location when the True Light would momentarily reappear to 
		their minds, convicting them of the impropriety of a previous focus.<br class="auto-style135">
		</span></span></p>
		<p style="font-size: xx-small" class="auto-style142">
		<span class="auto-style2">The young 
		vine knew well the true significance of those images made by Yavram: it 
		could feel its proof in its first branches. Every vine is fashioned to 
		focus only upon the True Light, which is as the center pillar of its 
		growth. It consumes that pillar inch by inch, moment by moment, as it 
		grows. Without the center pillar of light, the vine would surely 
		languish; but without the supportive pillars of left and right, the vine 
		would sprawl aimlessly upon the ground. Even this parable, however, had 
		been more truly stated in the temple of Light established in 
		Yahrushaliem.</span><span class="auto-style143"><span class="auto-style2"><br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">The growing vine's 
		ancestors had taught him that the pillar on the left hand, as vines look 
		into the sky, represents the services of tillage; the right-hand pillar, 
		the services of irrigation. These two functions are essential to the 
		process of growth, but the beginning of growth comes only in response to 
		the warmth of the central pillar's light. Moreover, as the pillars at 
		the sides stand by to assist the vine in its season of growth, it is 
		surely the True Light's crossings in the sky that answer need, enabling 
		the branches of the vine to lean somewhat on the lesser pillars in the 
		breathtaking process of maturation.<br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">The man's focus 
		was strong; for the left and right functions in him were fully dedicated 
		to their services in the Earth. When the downward thrust of these 
		functions reached the man's foundational center, they willingly turned 
		of themselves to channel their full energies upwards along the center 
		path in the man, thus uniting every faculty in the service of the single 
		Light in him.<br class="auto-style135"><br class="auto-style135">
		It is told among the vines of Earth that the 
		three pillars are universal in all things. A growing thing that imagines 
		itself as containing only one of the three knows little of himself. Such 
		a one is searching his soul as from without-- from the right or from the 
		left. If one should rise by such means, such means there is no strength 
		to contend with the forces of life. A house divided so cannot stand.<br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">All things have 
		their own, proper center in the single Light of creation. Focused 
		therein, all things are both clean and supportive of life. It is 
		prophesied that when this knowledge spreads upon the Earth from the 
		greatest to the least, that Earth will reel under the weight of its own 
		productivity; for all life will then unite in knowledgeable cooperation, 
		as One in One.<br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">Tomorrow's 
		increase would serve that day. Already, the vine's blossoms had opened. 
		Already, they had been pollinated in the interchange between form and 
		function. Already, the young kernels were nearing completion. If the man 
		should also be blessed in his slumbers as he had been blessed in the 
		evening sacrifice, the morning would provide him abundant seed to take 
		to the marketplace to exchange for garments and to give as alms for the 
		renewal of friendships.<br class="auto-style135">
		<br class="auto-style135">As the vine began 
		to wither in its full age, it was content. The night had been one that 
		would be remembered among the ancients of the peas. It is not that this 
		particular specimen would be celebrated in the stories of the species, 
		but that the True Vine had been faithfully served by the life of one of 
		its brethren in the service of One.<br class="auto-style135">
		</span></span></p>
		<p style="font-size: xx-small" class="auto-style142">
		<span class="auto-style135">
		<span class="auto-style2">The monk stirred from his sleep. He had been 
		dreaming of a herd of deer standing quietly by the window and looking in 
		at him. Morning had come upon Earth, and he understood that the deer 
		were waiting to be fed. He smiled at the Watchers and untangled his long 
		arms and legs from around the Lotus. As he stretched into the Light of 
		another new beginning, his hands were filled with seed.</span></span></p>
