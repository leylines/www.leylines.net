		<p class="auto-style106">Our examination of the sephiroth as they appear in Adam Kadmon will be 
			closer than in their appearances in the Crown Diamond diagram, in which the unity of the spheres is 
			a vital factor, and in which the intricacies of correlation make exposition difficult in these early days of its study on Earth. In Adam Kadmon the foundational facets, or distinctions, of each sphere 
			(1 Cor. 12) are of paramount 
			concern. In the Crown Diamond the collective uniformity as fabric of 
			the Breath 
			is emphasized, by which perspective the many facets combine to display 
			the perfect brilliance of the Foundation Stone 
			(Eph. 4).</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">If these claims seem a little grandiose, 
			they are nevertheless not far from the every-day reality of the Creation parable of the 
			flesh. Experience teaches us that, though distinct from the eye, the 
			hand can function in one accord with the power of the elohim of sight, 
			as sight in the power of the Elohim of touch: the ability to reach 
			out and examine is common to the Intelligence that controls and 
			utilizes the faculties. The outward differences 
			of the bodily members are among our greatest blessings; for although it is by 
			the distinct delineation of each member that the fullness of 
		<a href="God.html">Elohim</a> 
			is perceived, it is by the coordinated functioning of all 
			members that the ineffable unity of Elohim is understood.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			<span class="auto-style36">The sephiroth of Adam Kadmon have been given many labels by many students of the scriptures over many centuries, 
			and we affirm the fruit of sincere efforts to understand their meanings. 
			We therefore accept kabbalah-- the "received" tradition-- on the 
			whole, though not always the letter of traditional writings. As for 
			myself, I have 
			particular reservations against those branches of kabbalah that concern themselves with magical applications. 
			Such approaches, if validated&nbsp; by results, nevertheless exalt themselves above the will of </span> 
			<span class="auto-style102">hwhy</span><span class="auto-style36">, 
			who can perform wonders without our aid or surrogacy 
			(John 5:30) and 
			has made it quite clear that it is not for us to direct our 
			steps--that is, to concoct agendas for our time on Earth, but to 
			receive the blessings that comes by waiting upon HaShem to lead us 
			in the way we should go.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			There are some for whom the term "tradition" will be a 
			stumbling block because of the literal words of Y'shúa and the prophets. 
			However, it wasn't the traditions, themselves, that brought offense, 
			but the manner of observance. To wash cups and such by the Holy Spirit is to wash within, as the cups are understood to be found within; 
			and the sephiroth are such cups. To designate something as 
			<em>korban</em> in the Spirit is to know its proper use; for the Holy Spirit dwelling in 
			each of us is able to communicate its use, directly-- both implicitly, as we continue to walk in Ruach HaQodesh, and also explicitly, should we begin to stray from the Spirit's constant and reliable guidance.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">Traditional conceptions of the sephiroth are scattered throughout the religious writings of time. One interested in mystical kabbalah might well begin with 
		<em>The Zohar</em> ("The Splendor"), which is now available in its entirety in English translation, on the web as well as in print. An excellent primer for historical kabbalah can be found in 
			<em>Encyclopedia Judaica</em>, 
			which is available at most larger libraries. A good overview of basic concepts and approaches can be obtained in the reprint of Dion Fortune's book, 
			<em>The Mystical Qabalah</em>. As every man must witness according to the measure of truth entrusted to him, 
		(Gal. 6:5), this presentation will largely confine itself to those understandings given to its author by HaShem, "<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/first1.JPG">who giveth to all men</a> liberally
			<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/second1.JPG">and upbraideth not</a>" 
		(James 1:5)<span class="auto-style36">.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style106"><span class="auto-style36">
		The sephiroth are numbered from One to Ten. Some students begin conscious study of the spheres at Emanation One; others, at Ten; and still others, at Six. My conscious study of the sephiroth began with Sphere Nine, which is commonly rendered 
		<em>Yesod</em>, or "Foundation": "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is 
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Jesus Christ</a>"-- Jesu Christos, Khristos Iesous, 
			<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shúa</a>
		<a href="../Matthew/50messiah.html">haMashiyach</a>: Joshua, son of Nun/None-- son of potentiality, of perpetuity; son of Noon 
			(1 Cor. 3:11): Yah's Sh&uacute;a: the appearance of the Salvation of
			<span class="auto-style102"> hy</span> 
			(Yah/Jah/YH),  
			as proclaimed and manifested by the anointed One of
			</span>
			<span class="auto-style102"> hwhy</span><span class="auto-style36">/Unity 
			(Is. 29:21). Having so begun, I will so proceed.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
		<img class="auto-style100" height="185" src="stubborn.gif" style="float: left" width="198">When I first examined Adam Kadmon, my attention fell upon Yesod 
			(Prov. 9:12). I saw within the diagram a 
			symbol of the physical body, with bound feet below (Malkuth) and with arms outstretched above (Hod, 
			Netsach). I saw an image suggestive of the earthly crucifixion of 
			Messiah. Without instruction in the mysteries of kabbalah, I 
			understood, by seeing first the cross of the Jesus of Evangelical 
			American Protestantism, that the symbol belonged to "things 
			Christian," whether or not it was very "Christian" to investigate 
			further.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">But look further I did-- higher, as it were: to discover, in the next court, what I took to be the cross of the resurrected Messiah, and which I later came to understand as being representative, also, of the spiritual cross borne by 
			the heavenly Messiah from the foundation of the world 
			(Rev. 13:8). What had appeared from the view below as 
		<img class="auto-style98" height="187" src="sepo2.tardy.gif" style="float: right" width="202"><div class="auto-style3">
		</div>
		outstretched arms (Gevurah, Netsach) became as liberated feet above. The new body mass became Tipareth (Beauty), and the new pair of outstretched arms (Din, Chesed) spoke no longer of surrender, but of power. In the two perceptions, I 
			was thereby reminded of the death, burial, and the resurrection of Mashiyach.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">Looking two courts higher, I saw a Trinitarian conception (Chokmah, Binah, Kether, and began to understand the meaning of the scripture, 
		"No man cometh to the Father, but by me." I had not yet come to the Father, though 
		he has been always with me (Ps. 139:8), nor yet to any real comprehension of the Unity of the concepts of Father, Son, and Spirit; but I found that my mind was now, somehow, more ordered for 
		the approach. In growing faith that the Son would someday reveal the Unity to me 
		(Deut. 6:4; Matt. 11:27), I turned my attention once again inward, and to those aspects of the sephiroth that speak of things familiar-- of the 
		First Adam.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
		<img class="auto-style93" height="138" src="tardo.2.gif" style="float: left" width="198">Not everyone, as I have said, will find themselves beginning this 
			study as I began. We all walk the same path 
			(James 2:10), but 
			awareness of the journey comes at different points in the walk for 
			different people (Rom. 5:8). Some may need to begin, consciously, at 
			Malkuth, the tenth emanation, also known as "Kingdom.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
		In the simplified view of the meanings of Malkuth, this is the foot of the earthly cross of Messiah Y'sh&uacute;a, as implied earlier. If you have yet to come to know 
			ImmanuAL, the inward personage of Mashiyach, whose yoke is easy and 
			whose burden is Light-- you <em>must</em> begin at this parable 
		sooner or later, whether consciously or not; for the Presence of HaShem 
		opens only to his own (John 10:1-2, 11-14; Rev. 3:7); and it is at 
		Golgotha that one declares his fealty.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			No man can come to the Father, except the Father draws him in, but 
			any man can knock on the door. Every door has two sides, so apply 
			the teaching by Y'sh&uacute;a by taking it up a notch, "In all things whatsoever ye would that 
			(men) should do to you, do ye even so to (them): for this is the law and the prophets" 
			(Matt. 7:12). If you would have HaShem open unto you, you must first open unto Him 
			(Rev. 3:20).</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			Even so I began, before my first encounter 
			with <a href="adam.html">Adam Kadmon</a>, having become disgusted with a worldly life of 
			mixed success. As I looked forward to the various futures possible 
			for me in the world of men, I concluded that the best of them could 
			not satisfy my soul; and I gladly left everything, counting it as 
			nothing, to wander here and there between pivotal locales of my 
			abandoned life, having decided that nothing mattered to me more than a 
			personal acquaintance with the illusive man called Jesus. Even in 
			this context of personal resolve and religious preconditioning, 
			however, I had but a dim awareness of what I was doing, day to 
			aimless day; and I had hardly 
			any inkling of what turns my life might take if my spiritual hunger 
			were to be satisfied.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			I was so nearly a fool! My mind was still imprisoned by religious 
			expectations hammered into me from infancy; and I nearly believed, subconsciously, that I would encounter Messiah-- literally-- on some street, somewhere!&nbsp; And, so, I did, after a fashion: 
			but not on the street. just off of it, while taking a stolen rest on a poker table in New York City's Greenwich Village, at a place, now gone, called "Singapore Sam's Cafe Caricature." I remember thinking, through the confusion of drugs, "There 
			<em>must</em> be some way to talk with God directly!</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			And there is! I remember my head turning (I'm quite sure 
			<em>I</em> didn't turn it), 
			then seeing-- as it were-- a hole appear in the dilapidated wall to my right, providing a 
			curtained window to unknown regions through an ambient halo of green. "I wonder what 
			<em>that</em> is?" I thought. "Maybe it's the Holy Spirit," came an answer. 
			</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			I deserved the retort, but not the blessing of its promise. A "dreamer" from my youth and now 
			given into 
			drugs, I had become accustomed to such things as voices that seemed to come from 
			nowhere. Portions of the universe had appeared and 
			disappeared, unexpectedly, without explanation, after all. As consequence, I 
			gave the experience a brief moment of such serious thought still 
			possible to my hedonistic mind; and I expected no 
			real answer to what I had not seriously recognized as a prayer. My 
			expression of interest had more of an aside than a prayer. The "Holy 
			Spirit?" Far out! I 
			gave a mental shrug to the dimly measured and (I thought) somewhat 
			sarcastic remark from the corners of consciousness. I was ready to 
			give the whole episode leeway to recede, quietly, into my 
			subconscious.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			Immediately, as the thought began to fade, it was as though a balloon filled with 
			heavy air had burst over my body: whoosh! . . . and I was no longer my own, although I had yet to realize it. Nothing had prepared me for the magnanimity of God's grace and the free gift of 
			his salvation, which is the presence of his Holy Breath within the hearts of 
			his children. By the way, I don't capitalize God's pronouns; for we 
			are made in accordance with his likeness and his image, and male and 
			female created he <em>them</em>.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			Just minutes after baptism in the Holy 
			Spirit, I heard a commotion on the street. "Guess I'll go see what's 
			happening," I thought. When I came to the stoop at the front of the 
			store, I saw a big black man walking down the street and waving his 
			arms, saying, "Praise God! Hallelu-<span class="auto-style102">hy</span>! You people don't know nothing, but 
			<em>I</em> know! Praise God!" As I watched him near the corner of Bleecker 
			Street, my conscious thought was, "There goes another nut!" The old 
			man in me scoffed, but the still-subconscious mind of the babe being 
			born in me watched with eyes filled with wonder.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			The verbalized thought of dismissal had barely cleared the 
			overcharged synapses of my simmering brain, when I spontaneously 
			emptied everything from my pockets and headed Uptown, saying to 
			everyone I met, "Jesus is coming!" without understanding why I was 
			doing it. I wasn't confused beyond my norm, particularly: just 
			contentedly blank, willing to go with the flow; and that was good 
			enough for me.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			When I reached Central Park, I thought I might follow bicycle trails I had walked before; but the City had 
			begun excavations to lay new sewage pipes down the center of my 
			known paths, and they were blocked off. Just a little perplexed, and not knowing what else to do, I headed back Downtown by the West Side Docks, a new experience. A day tripper way out of his element as night approached, I 
			worried that I needed help at one point; and I imagined that an angel came to walk beside me. One of the passers-by must have seen it there; for he jumped out of my way as though repelled by a magnetic charge. He was street-hip, no doubt.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			I think it occurred to me that it was distinctly possible that things were now, somehow, somewhat different! I wandered around for a day or so in this deliberation, walking through familiar routines without 
			my usual dissatisfaction, until I found myself in front of a big, imposing church. Upon arriving there, something in me stopped! I can't really say that I stopped. Not knowing why, I stood there 
			foolishly, waiting a noticeable moment for I knew not what with some 
			conscious unease. A tiny voice said, "Go <em>
			in</em> and wait." I did.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			Inside, I it dawned on me that I was inside a church without having been forced 
			to go there, and that I believed that I was actually 
			<em>supposed</em> to be there! I had no idea why, beyond what 
			survived of my instruction as a child. I figured I might as well pray, or something, while waiting. I did my best. When closing time came, two men approached and said, "You'll have to leave, now; we're closing the doors for the night." They 
			were surprisingly respectful, sounding a lot like funeral directors. "He told me to wait here!" I protested. It was, as I considered the problem, rather 
			<em>nice</em> to have a place to sit.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			"Oh! He <em>
			did</em>, did he!?" they sneered. All pleasantries aside, they picked me up (one burly man grabbing each arm), yanked me out of the pew, and 
			literally threw me back into the street. At last I was certain that what was happening to me was some kind of religious experience 
			(John 16:2)! Remarkable, the verses that stick in the minds of those who have made no serious attempt to study scripture. Bless those men, I deserved it: I was still stoned
			(2 Sam. 7:14).</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			About a thousand mindless exclamations 
			later, I concluded that I had probably received the Holy Spirit
			[I wasn't altogether sure, as I 
			thought water baptism came first, or something (Acts 10 would have 
			helped a lot)] and that I had 
			better get myself to a <em>real</em> church somewhere to find out what ought to be done! After a few more days' lollygagging and marijuana smoking, I 
			decided to head home-- well, that's where I intended to go; but where I actually went was to the city of my natural birth and to the church of 
			a natural parent.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			After settling in with relatives for an extended stay while I 
			figured out what I was to do, I decided to go to a revival meeting and to obey whatever 
			those in charge said I should do, no matter how difficult. Sneaking into 
			what I considered to be their "Sin-a-Gog," I sat down in an inconspicuous place. The family was pleased to see me. As the singing began, it sounded more pleasant than I remembered. I was nearly ready to enjoy myself-- my still-stoned self-- when a Great Force literally yanked me out of the pew . . . 
			(Here I go, again! But this time, 
			I was being thrown back into the street without hands: nobody ever told me about Leviticus 10:9, and I hadn't read it!) 
			. . . and sent me on my way.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">
			The church followed me out, after no small confusion. I don't know how they found me; but when they caught up, I was firmly seated on a three-legged stool in my grandpa's abandoned workshop, 
			perched before a lighted candle I got from somewhere at some time 
			that I remember not at all. The garage was, otherwise, utterly dark; and I must 
			certainly have seemed demonic, a daring presence in the gloom that I 
			had prepared as defense for when whatever was going to happen, did. 
			So, there I was found sitting, in the single light of the candle, when the 
			congregation caught up with me.</p>
		<p class="auto-style106">"Why don't you come to me where I 
		<em>
			am</em>?" I pleaded. "Why must I first become 
			<em>pure</em>, in order to be saved?" The concepts and doctrines I had learned from my youth taught me-- in part because of my naturally convoluted reasoning-- that salvation was rather like a pat on the back for "doing the right thing." 
			Sitting there alone, before the judgment of ministers, family, and 
			friends, I had yet to learn that salvation is an ongoing <em>
			process</em>, and that the trappings belonging to the sinner that I had so long been would accompany me for so many more long years to come as I 
			traded them for new garments on the long path towards perfection. Ignorant of the 
			<em>process</em> of salvation, I saw my unworthiness reflected in 
		gaping eyes that ought to have regarded me as a brother, wretch though I 
		was. Perhaps they did; for the disaster of the evening was shared by all<span class="auto-style36">.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style106"><span class="auto-style36">
		Unprepared to grapple 
		with my reality because of tradition, the family church had no choice but to begin casting out devils. No doubt I was wrestling with a few 
			(Deut. 7:22), but my words of question to them came by the Holy Spirit; and the answer to those questions 
			came little by little on a fantastic journey of thirteen years to my water baptism-- it's coming still today, 
			truth be told, little by little! Baruch HaShem: Praise The Name of</span>
