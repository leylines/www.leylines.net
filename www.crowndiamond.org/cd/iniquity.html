		<td class="auto-style76">The name Lucifer means "Light Bearer." The 
		covering cherub of heaven, Lucifer was perfect in all his ways until iniquity 
		was found in him. It is commonly understood that "iniquity" is "grossly 
		unfair or immoral behavior." If that was the case, Lucifer's perfection was 
		conditioned on his performance: "perfect in all his ways, righteousness 
		was his to achieve and maintain, and his to 
		lose. If so, the inquity found in the Light Bearer was generated by an 
		active, narcissistic 
		pride, as it's written, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a 
		fall."<br><br>If Lucifer's fall was due to wickedness, the question 
		arises: "What was God's intent when appointing the great angel as the 
		'covering cherub'?" We are instructed t hat HaShem, alone, is perfect in 
		all his ways; and so, Lucifer was perfect only so far as he rested in 
		the perfection of the Father. My view of the judgment that befell 
		Lucifer is that the imperfection discovered in him came from a bending of the light he carried, 
		and not because of some innate fault of 
		his character. <br><br>Lucifer's his fall came subsequent to the 
		creation of Earth: the judgment 
		was that he should be cast down to Earth, where he would live and die as 
		a human being. Because it is said that he bore the perfect Light of 
		HaShem within himself before the fall, the iniquity that was, later, 
		found in him must have "crept into him: unawares," to 
		borrow the phrase. Many equate Lucifer with the devil, but scripture 
		does not accuse him of error: only that iniquity was found in himl\ the 
		perfection he once enjoyed was sullied from within.<br><br>If fault 
		there was, the light Lucifer carried must have played some part in his 
		deteriorization. Light behaves in accordance with the dynamics present 
		within all created things. The weight of the light he carried must have 
		been the cause of his corruption. Light, like all created this, is 
		subject to the pull of inertia; for the force of gravity accompanies all 
		mass in Creation, even if that mass is sub-atomic. <br><br>If that is 
		the case, iniquity has little to do with the tug-of-war between light 
		and darkness, good and evil. Iniquity is the spiritual equivalent of the latent 
		force of inertia. This is a reasonable conclusion; for the invisible 
		things of God are visible in the things that are made, suggesting that 
		iniquity is spiritual gravity, whose weighty pull marred Lucifer's 
		perfection. <br><br>Just as natural light curves as it arcs across the 
		vast dimensions of the universe because of the pull of mass, spiritual 
		light is also affected by body mass, whether the life form is human or 
		angelic. I don't believe that the fate of Lucifer was the result of sin 
		or some behavior error, precisely; rather, I think the iniquity found in 
		him was akin to the nature of the Light, itself: At the core of all 
		things, light is the cohesive element of the universe. Even rocks are 
		children of Light: over eons, light became trapped in the pull of 
		matter. Rocks absorb it, vegetation drinks it down, storing it in roots, 
		that it may transform it into food to sustain animal&nbsp; life. Without 
		the phenomenon of light, there would be nothing at, nor would there be 
		any where.<br><br>I conclude that Lucifer's fall did not disqualify him 
		from grace; for the iniquity found in him was not of his doing, but was 
		akin to the pull inertia imposes upon Creation' matter. Neither good nor 
		bad, inertia is a latent force capable of bending light; and Lucifer's 
		imperfection was among its effects. With the command, "Let there be," 
		Lucifer was fated to tumble from the immortal realm into the mortal realm, 
		vulnerable to the phenomenon of acretion, which is akin to incarnation. 
		Although light has a nearly negligible mass, the weight of its photons 
		renders it succeptible to the iniquity of gravity.<br><br>Beginnings 
		have endings. The loss of Lucifer's heavenly state brought radical change, but not 
		tragic change. God is good. Aware of that goodness, the angels of HaShem shouted for joy at 
		the creation of 
		man, whose physical form, comprised of stored light, that is capable of 
		receiving, then reflecting or projection, spiritual light as well.<br>
		<br>As time unfolded, mankind would become chariots of Ruach HaQodesh, 
		God's Holy Spirit, serving as vehicles for angelic transformation. 
		Living and dying as men, the hosts of heaven would enter upon the task 
		of establishing unique identities they could carry into life 
		everlasting, which was HaShem's intent, from the beginning. The great 
		wedding feast aproaches; and on that day, the incarnate souls who loved 
		the Light of God will become transfigured, no longer mere <em>bearers</em> 
		of Light, but as beings of Light.Working out their perfection during 
		their lives on Earth, they shall become transformed into <em>beings</em> 
		of Light through the renewal of their minds. <br><br>
		<img class="auto-style77" height="354" src="phoenix.gif" style="float: left" width="187">This 
		mystery is among 
		the things the early followers of Y'shua were unable to bear. They were 
		unprepared:&nbsp; not because of 
		failings or weaknesses, but because the demands of order follow 
		sequence. The walk in the steps of messiah is led and paced by Ruach 
		HaQodesh, which rewards he faithful with gifts of knowledge concerning 
		the nature and ways of HaShem. 
		There was war--unruliness-- in Heaven because it was of paramount 
		importance that God's sons learn and understand "this," so&nbsp; they 
		would be able to endure, conquer, and triumph over "that."<br>
		<br>In times past, the apostle lamented that the mystery of iniquity was 
		alr already at work among early believers in the Way, the Truth, and the 
		Life. From the last seder of mashiyach Y'shua to the uproars of this 
		present day, stumbles among believers were apparent and remain apparent. 
		The weight of iniquity takes its toll because the lessons are difficult: 
		impossible, except through the guidance of HaShem, and that's the point: 
		the path of the cross 
		leads to knowledge of the intersection of the mortal and immortal 
		realms, teaching us of God's love as we make our way back home. Far greater than the light 
		found in natural man, the Light within spiritual man is the very 
		essence of the Godhead. Called to walk in the perfection of Father and 
		Son, mankind must carry the Treasure of God's Light, which is the very 
		Life of HaShem, in 
		earthen vessels that must have an end.<br><br>Living the life of the Spirit in mortal bodies 
		is a dynamic experience, and the mass of physical man man's body exerts 
		the 
		equivalent of the latent force of inertia within the new creature, the 
		spiritual man. This is why Paul saw two laws operating within himself, 
		and why the scripture speaks of twins struggling within the womb. This 
		is why it is 
		written, "I would not have you ignorant; for the end shall not come, except there be a falling away, 
		first." <br><br>The fabled phoenix once flew near the Source of Light, but 
		its wings caught fire, and the creature burned, falling to the ground at 
		its first approach to the light of heaven. Having fallen back to Earth, 
		it was incumbent upon the phoenix to gather itself from its ashes and to rise again. A roughly equivalent 
		experience 
		unfolds as natural man is consumed by inward fires, is reborn of the Holy Breath and 
		rises again as spiritual man, 
		joining the procession leading to the great wedding feast of the
		<a href="../Matthew/matthew1.html">Messiah of 
		Matthew 1:1</a><span class="auto-style81">, while walking in</span> the steps of
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">the man of Matthew 1:16</a>. In their 
		awakend state, walking the Earth in tandem with the Salvation that comes 
		by the will of God, believers are able to add knowledge to experience as, 
		rising from the ashes of the errors, they again 
		approach the gates of Heaven.<br><br>It is inevitable that the new 
		creature rising from the waters of baptism should stumble. Offense will 
		come, and woe to them who are the cause of it; but mercy and restoration 
		will come upon those who must experience offense.<br><br>If we say we are without sin, we 
		deceive ourselves; and the truth is not in us. If we confess our 
		errors-- our sins, however, the Holy Father of us all is faithful to forgive us and to 
		cleanse us from all unrighteousness.The filthy rags we wore in unrighteousness 
		are replaced with spotless clothing not in the pew, but in the world's 
		ditches, as those putting on the whoe armour of God in Messiah Yahushua lend helping hands to fallen 
		brothers. Should believers cordon themselves off from others they perceive 
		to be unrighteous sinners in order to protect their mistaken sense of their own 
		righteousness, they will discover that their lamps lack oil at the great 
		wedding feast. Itcomes nearer with every darkening day of Earth.<br><br>
		If we say we have no sin, no error, we deceive ourselves; and the Truth 
		is not in us. By 
		this we shall know that we are disciples of Master Y'shua, the Essene 
		Teacher of Righteousness: that we 
		have love for one another: and not only for others we see as good, but 
		for all who live. <br><br>Judge not. <br><br>Accuse not. <br><br>Remain 
		open to 
		love.</td>
