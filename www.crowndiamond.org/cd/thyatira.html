			<p style="text-align: center"><em>
			And unto the angel of 
			the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of Elohim, 
			who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like 
			fine brass; I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, 
			and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the 
			first.<br><br>
			Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, 
			because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a 
			prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit 
			fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her 
			space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. Behold, I 
			will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her 
			into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And I 
			will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know 
			that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give 
			unto every one of you according to your works.<br>
			<br>
			But unto you I 
			say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this 
			doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan as they 
			speak; I will put upon you none other burden. But that which ye have 
			already hold fast till I come.<br>
			<br>
			And he that 
			<a href="yisrael.gif">overcometh</a>, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the 
			nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as vessels of a 
			potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my 
			Father. And I will give him the morning star. He that hath an ear, 
			let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</em></p>
			</strong>
			<p class="auto-style2">The mansion of the morning star flies in 
			tandem with the sun in his circuits; for its silver windows are as 
			the first clear reflection of that great light's brilliance. Its 
			towers are with him in the East when the sun arises in his strength; 
			they are with him, also, in the West, as he turns to visit other 
			lands. Always near him: if we see them not in his appearances, their 
			absence brings no shame; for they often take rest in his aura.</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">
			<img height="304" src="m.stttar.gif" style="float: left; margin: 8px 10px" width="164">The glory of the sun outshines the mansion of 
			the morning, and he sometimes draws it too close against his 
			countenance for its lesser glory to be visible. Yet, it is very 
			bright, indeed: were it to pass before his face, it would not 
			greatly diminish the sun's shining. She who dwells therein may 
			linger in the night to carry some message to the moon; but she is 
			soon gone to rejoin her beloved, answering his call, to follow him 
			beyond our certain knowing.</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">The lady of the morning star is 
			known by some on Earth as Aphrodite, the embodiment of love. We do 
			not contest their view of her; for it arose in recognition of the 
			light within her soul; and it was inevitable that those who could 
			not fully probe her mysteries should name her according to their 
			perceptions. She is Venus: called Beauty, by men of the West, and 
			Tipareth, by men of the East. She it is who has the care of all 
			growing things. Her first name was 
			<a href="file:///D:/crowndiamond.org/Nod/Garden/Eve.html">ChauWah</a>.<br>
			<br>Seven points she has upon her crown, whose lights are mirrored seven times 
			in the chain she wears about her neck to soothe her fading 
			memories of the dark mountains she scaled on Earth in the early 
			days, before she was lifted from the seas. It is said by some that 
			she was born from the sea, arising full-grown from its ancient 
			depths upon a shell. This is true enough, but it is not strictly so.<br>
			<br>
			<img height="182" src="cit.thy.gif" style="float: right; margin: 8px 15px" width="200">She was first born past memory of mortal men in the garden of 
			bliss; her birth from the waters was as a second birth: the 
			beginning of her renewal in the mind of God. It is told she will be 
			carried in that shell-- as in an ark: again, as in a chariot of 
			fire-- through and beyond the center of all things, to be seated, at 
			the end of days, in her destined place, beyond the partings of all 
			the veils.<br>
			<br>At the inward points of her crown are seven narrow 
			windows that shine as silver paths upon her necklace below. We call 
			the light that rims these windows silver, but it is the color of 
			transcendence, a merging of the visible and the invisible spectra. 
			The windows begin as narrow paths of light; for she first walked 
			visible realms by narrow roads, which fanned and broadened inwardly 
			in her travels, to converge upon a path that lifted her safely to 
			the orb of another, denser firmament than we have known-- a sky 
			capable of bearing the negligible weight of such a one as she.<br>
			<br>Neither is the mansion that lies beneath those skies truly known 
			to men: the firmament of her world was fashioned as her covering. 
			Neither could men live there, should they succeed in their vain 
			efforts to gain her world without her leave and the consent of her 
			beloved; for the jealous sun would blaze in tireless wrath against 
			their mortal frames, overwhelming their every precaution, should 
			they accost the dwelling of his love.</p>

			<br>
			<img height="97" src="hubA.flute.gif" style="float: right; margin-left: 11px; margin-right: 11px" width="130">Flying Arrow lay aside his flute and rested quietly upon the 
			earth. He had been watching his brother, the hawk, climb higher and 
			higher on the hunt, wishing he, too, might fly. He wondered at his 
			desire; for, truly, he was content as the Great Father had made him.<br>
			<br>The manitous were closer kin and flew higher than the hawk; but 
			he, as yet, had no desire to be as they-- formless, so it seemed, 
			except in their appearances to men, when they assumed the forms most 
			convenient to their messages. He understood, at last, that it was 
			not the giddy freedom of his brother hawk he coveted: he wanted 
			simply to experience the currents of the sun's breath as clearly as 
			he felt the insistent warmth of its face upon his own in the heat of 
			the day.<br><br>
			Instantly upon his understanding, the hawk began to 
			dive. The harder it fell, however, the higher Flying Arrow's spirit 
			arose within himself. It seemed his every memory was being lifted 
			up-- was changing, in his ascent, to truer images of themselves than 
			they had ever been on Earth. Small, forgotten details of 
			unremembered days began to burst with meanings unimagined; and, 
			soon, he was asleep.<br>
			<br>In the first beginning of his slumbers, 
			he saw his brother, Flying Arrow, laying quietly upon the ground and 
			looking up at him. As he looked more closely, he could see the seven 
			strands of silver as they began to travel outward from the golden 
			bowl surrounding the boy's head. The features of his face were as 
			seven expressions, opening first into the silver cord; and, soon, 
			all of Flying Arrow appeared therein, to begin the frequent climb 
			beyond the sky.<br>
			<br>How glorious the Great Father had made this 
			son of all the worlds! Water, earth, air, and fire, and even things 
			beyond hawk's knowing were as One to such as he. And yet, it was as 
			though the man, himself, did not know these things.<br>
			<br>Many 
			times the Great Father had commanded the hawk to perch upon the arm 
			of a manitou to signal its approach unto a son of man who might not, 
			otherwise, notice. Not even this care was always sufficient to gain 
			the attention of unthinking men, however; for the manitou sometimes 
			sounded his trumpet through the hawk's cries to alert them of his 
			coming. This nearly always won the attention of men, but the hawk 
			was not certain that it also won their understanding of the 
			significance of his service.<br>
			<br>The hawk began to dive against 
			the serpent crawling towards the feet of Flying Arrow, and the 
			manitou freed his servant to other service. Then, reaching out his 
			right hand from behind the outer veils, the manitou gently cradled 
			the sleeping man within his palm and began the long and intricate 
			journey to the Father of Lights. The man had been summoned before 
			the Throne beyond the heavens. He would speak, in later years, of 
			Unity. What more might be expected?</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">
			<strong>Selah</strong>.<br>
			<br>She remembered trying to explain to her first teacher that there 
			was no difference whatsoever between and . The teacher had mocked 
			the child before the whole class, saying, "And I suppose you would 
			think that there's no difference between an arrow and a bird, simply 
			because they both can fly and both have feathers!" If the teacher 
			had not taunted her with that particular rebuke, she might have 
			hated him forever; but in the child's later studies, she ran across 
			an Eastern parable that goes, "Words are birds; and birds are 
			arrows, to the wise."<br>
			<br>As she thought on the teacher's words, 
			she realized that it was her own immaturity that had opened the door 
			for the teacher's treatment of her. She ought not to have said, 
			"whatsoever." She had followed the words, like arrows, to the source 
			of the disagreement. There were, indeed, differences between and , 
			as she could now clearly see; but the difference between the two 
			letters rested in the realms of perspective.<br>
			<br>This last 
			teacher had given the class a word they had never before 
			encountered. Not a particularly difficult problem, it would seem. 
			The class had been assigned to translate the new word from the 
			Hebrew without the help of a Hebrew dictionary. It didn't seed so 
			difficult, and it would be so easy to cheat! But "words are birds," 
			she remembered; so she decided to toss the new word into the sky 
			within her mind to see what it would do and where it would land.</p>

			<img src="tpart.gif" style="float: right; margin-top: 0px;">taw</strong></em>, the first letter: numerical

			phonetic equivalent: <em>t, th</em>.<br>
			<br><em><strong>pe</strong></em>, the second

			<hr style="height: 3px; color: #740F3D;" class="auto-style2">
			<p class="auto-style2">As she considered the problem before her, she 
			thought that she just might succeed, if she only knew a little more! 
			The values of the letters would begin to merge into a unified 
			concept in her mind, but some element was missing or-- as with her 
			earlier dilemma while facing comparison of and -- not fully 
			developed or expressed, thus preventing completion of her 
			assignment.<br>
			<br>Throwing the letters once more into her mind, she 
			realized that their individual sounds were not united, as in a word; 
			and she reasoned, therefore, that the element of sound was the 
			source of her difficulty. She decided that she would have to do some 
			research on the functions and significances of sound in language, 
			and that it would be well to begin by better understanding the words 
			"phoneme" and "phonetic."<br>
			<br>Opening her English 
			dictionary to the appropriate place, her eyes fell on an 
			alphabetical table entitled, "Phoenician Alphabet." There, before 
			her, were the same number of letters as in the Hebrew, bearing the 
			same names and having the same numerical significations and phonetic 
			renderings. The Hebrew <em>taw</em> corresponded to the Phoenician , 
			also named <em>taw</em>, and also pronounced as 
			<em>t</em>, or 
			<em>
			th</em>.<br>
			<br>"It's really beautiful," she thought, "how these 
			things work out! If I learn the differences between <em>
			x</em> and
			<em>t</em> well enough, I may end by learning that I knew it all 
			before I first began!"<br>
			<br>She mused upon the mysteries of 
			knowledge and of their foundations in the world of experience, and a 
			fragment of verse composed by one of her school fellows came into 
			her thoughts without fanfare and without explanation: "I will wear a 
			purple shirt before I'm old: my spinning hands will whirl the web's 
			wheel around its axis, until the hub splits loose 
			<img height="168" src="huba.wheel.gif" style="float: left; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px" width="142">and spills each 
			single part unto its single destination. And then I'll sigh, I 
			think, and watch my body wrinkle in smiles."</p>
			<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;<strong><span class="auto-style135">Selah</span></strong>.</p>
			<p class="auto-style8"><span class="auto-style2">An ancient soul, the old man watched his prayer wheel complete a final turn 
			and circle to a stop. It was time, again, to say, "Amen." However 
			much he troubled the waters above with his mantras on behalf of the 
			thousands who lived within his chakras, the open center never 
			moved-- however long its agitations might continue! As had been his 
			custom for many years, he would close his prayers in the four lower 
			realms, leaving their closing in the four higher realms to the mind 
			belonging to his body of light.<br>
			<br>"Om mani pedme hum." As 
			above, so below. The fires of inner Earth are quiet, and her pores 
			are open to the waters. "Om manye paedmehumn." As above, so below. 
			The waters have found the lowest place and are filling every bowl. "Om." 
			As above, so below. The waters are tranquil: they are open to the 
			air. "Om." The air is still: it is drinking. "Aom." The fire is 
			burning in the thin vapors of the upper air. "Aum."<br>
			<br>He gently 
			laid the prayer wheel beneath his crossed legs and slowly crossed 
			his arms. Tomorrow, the lilies would open to the sky; the budded 
			rose would learn her destiny and service. Another interval of rest, 
			and then the dawn. I charge you, O daughters of the Chakras, that 
			you stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.&nbsp;</span><br>
