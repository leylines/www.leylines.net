<p class="auto-style33">The alphabets of Western mankind are inherent to the Crown Diamond 
grid. From their prototypical appearance in the Phoenician, which is also known as Paleo-Hebrew, as Sinaitic Hebrew, as Proto-Canaanite, and as Ancient Arabic, the characters of the original <em>alefbet</em> 
might be said to have evolved, from age to age, as inventions resulting from the 
cultural interactions between peoples. That the Western writing systems share a 
common source based on the geometry of Creation would argue that the alphabets 
are as likely to be revelations as inventions.</p>
<p class="auto-style33">If they began as stick characters drawn in the mud, the 
alphabets may have been transformed over time by those who used them. It's also 
possible that rudimentary examples of stylized alphabets are handwriting samples 
of a known standard. My handwriting, for example, just barely resembles the 
letters I learned to draw in school. In either case, I would argue&nbsp; that changes 
in the alphabets are reflections of spiritual changes within man; for it's 
doubtful that secret societies of adepts arose, from time to time, to engineer an orderly evolution 
in ciphers to record thoughts and transactions. It's more likely that, 
revelation of a better way of writing gave rise to its adepts. </p>
		<p class="auto-style33">In the Crown Diamond diagram, it is demonstrated 
		that the alphabets of Western man share a common origin in the Tree of Life, 
		which is said to bear twelve manners of fruit, according to its seasons. 
		My view is that, shifting with the ages, the alphabets of man have appeared among 
		its peoples according to the will of Elohim, much as leaves of the Tree: falling 
		away at the conclusion of an age and appearing in subsequent ages in new, but related, configurations.</p>
		<p class="auto-style33"><span class="auto-style33">In their transformations over time, therefore, 
I see the hand of </span> 
<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style36"><span class="auto-style33"> giving 
focus to the revelation of immutable Truth. In the beginning, Phoenician extreme, the <em>alefbet</em> spoke broadly of principles. 
Its words rarely denoted any specific thing, and communication was the result of 
juggling connotations, which accounts for the magnificent complexity of the lively oracles of Elohim, 
as written in the Moses script. To preserve the Oral Tradition of the Sinai 
Torah without the luxury of a priesthood dedicated to that end, Ezra began a 
shift to specificity that led, ultimately, to the translations of the Masoretes.
</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style33">Than<span class="auto-style33">ks in no small 
		part to Ezra, we say it's written that HaShem will magnify Torah and 
		make it glorious. The block script fulfills that prophecy in the sense 
		that, as through a magnifying glass, the essence of the Oral Tradition 
		is easier to grasp. However, the Babylonian script-- especially in its 
		most elaborate iterations-- is exclusive, secular: very like the coded 
		ciphers of state craft. The Aramaic takes the key of knowledge out of 
		reach of the nations, making Torah's magnification among the nations 
		more difficult and less glorious, as the fullness of what is written 
		depends not only on interpretation of its letters, but also upon the 
		brand of its letters. This colors HaShem the god of the dot and the 
		tittle, but not of the upper and lowercases.</span></p>

Another age is descending upon us from above: the millennial age of Messiah's government, that 
with the Kingdom of Names, comes the good pleasure of HaShem
<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style36">. I 
would not expect new configurations of the characters of the alphabet in the coming age, but rather a complete synthesis of 
the revelations committed to previous forms of writing, including that of Ezra 
and those who followed with him. We shall understand the Phoenician and Greek nuances in the English, both linguistically and numerically, as also the English in the Phoenician, and so forth. 
And we will be astonished; for all things that have ever been written-- from inconsequential memoranda of men to the holy scriptures, themselves-- will be 
understood as representing the holy grid of Creation. As the words of Torah are 
traced on the interlocking Adam Kadmons of Crown Diamond grid, they will impact 
our physical bodies and transform our minds. Their vibrations within can be 
attuned to their vibrations without, so that we can say to this mountain, "Be 
removed," and it will be; for with
<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style36">, 
nothing is impossible.</p>
<p><span class="auto-style33">Incomparable, the wisdom of Elohim, who has hidden the 
branches of the Tree of Life in our daily lives from the time of the first Adam! There is but one Tree: it is our eating that distinguishes the 
manner of fruit. When its revelation in our midst is complete </span> 
<span class="auto-style39">(Gen. 3:24; Rev. 2:7; Luke 17:21)</span><span class="auto-style33">, we shall find that we 
are accustomed to some of the twelve manner of fruits already </span> 
<span class="auto-style39">(John 6:53)</span><span class="auto-style33">, which 
has prepared our intellectual metabolisms for those fruits which have yet to appear to our sensibilities. Truly, </span> 
<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style36"><span class="auto-style33"> is an El of Order, and He has founded His troop in the Earth
</span>
<span class="auto-style39">(Amos 9:6)</span><span class="auto-style33">. What a glorious day, when we shall see Him face-to-face 
among us, as also face-upon-face within us! Baruch HaShem, in the name of Yahush&uacute;a!</span></p>

		<td style="width: 650">This presentation traces the letters of the <em>alefbet</em> as they move from the Phoenician to the Latinate languages. Many variants have appeared on Earth during the time the various scripts have been in use, and not all variants are illustrated. Were it possible for this writer, it would yet be impractical and pointless, for example, to locate on the Crown Diamond all the ways individuals form the English letters in this age, let alone all variants from all English periods. As handwriting standards are both known and ignored by some writing English, so have the Ancient Greek and Phoenician standards been both known and ignored in times past. The standards exist, however; and it is by those standards that we recognize the variants, enabling the culture as a whole to read and to understand the work of many different scribes.</td>

		<p class="auto-style33">It is not possible to overemphasize the importance of the alphabets to spiritual understanding. The "Logos/Word" of John 1:1 is a direct reference to the <em>alefbet</em>, 
referring to the Torah's most prevalent word form, 
<img class="auto-style43" height="19" src="ta.12.gif" width="32">, rendered as the Alpha/Omega 
of Greek scriptures. The twenty-two characters of the Ancient Hebrew from&nbsp;
<img class="auto-style44" height="19" src="a.10.gif" width="16">/<em>alef</em> to
<img class="auto-style44" height="17" src="t.10.gif" width="19">/<em>taw</em> are 
		pictograms of the Principles of Elohim, whose image we mirror.&nbsp;There are 
		now many sources on the web to pursue understanding of Torah's original 
		alphabet. My name for the language is Paleo.</p>
		<p class="auto-style33"><span class="auto-style33">The tables of this 
		partition fall into two categories. First is the Phoenician, the 
		Paleo-Hebrew because the <em>alefbet</em> was in use by the patriarchs 
		and affirmed in its importance by the Angel of </span>
		<img class="auto-style44" height="16" src="file:///C:/Users/bfint/Documents/crowndiamond.org/cd/owcwhy.10.gif" width="84"><span class="auto-style33">, 
		when Moshe was given Ten Sayings and instructed to see to the pattern 
		shown to him on Mount Sinai.. Second&nbsp; are the tables of transition, 
		skirt the Ancient Greek, the Roman capitals, and the lowercase letters 
		of modern scripts. I call them transitional alphabets because we have 
		yet to come to a pure language and a pure speech, but we have the sense 
		that the fulfillment of that saying is very close.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style33">It isn't within the capability of this writer to set forth the synthesized interpretations of the alphabet that shall appear in the future age: the age is not quite born. It is 
my belief, however, that these tables will speak to those who shall follow about the direction their studies of language should take.</p>
<p class="auto-style33">A most significant resource for learning of the <em>alefbet</em> is the text of Psalm 119. Paleo 
texts are available. These are not dead letters in a dead language. To the 
contrary, they are oracular images that speak of the Principles of the great I AM. 
Have no other focus in your studies; for the five smooth stones of the Paleo-Hebrew Torah 
comprise the lively oracles of Elohim.</p>
<p class="auto-style33">Following the tables illustrating the alphabet are a few pages exploring possible approaches to various characters of the alphabets according to their situations on the Tree of Life. It is written, "every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old." </p>
<p class="auto-style33">Let us not despise the new because it has yet to show the polish that comes with age; likewise, let us not forsake the old simply because new things 
have appeared and are appearing. If old things seem to pass, it is because their essence 
has filled the new (Eccl. 1:9-11). HaShem is an El of order, and He does all things well. Praise The Name that, in Him, there is no shadow of changing, and that He has endowed mutability with the potential of 
attaining comprehension of immutability, unto His glory and our edification. 
Barak-El.</p>
