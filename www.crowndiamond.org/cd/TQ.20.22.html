		<p class="auto-style4">So many translations, and so nearly the same,            and others not here accounted for! Sense of time and order varies,            according to the verb tense chosen for translation (there is            only a general sense of tense in the original). English word            choice for key phrases colors translation, here and there-- whether            towards sternness or reasonableness, for example.</p>
			<p class="auto-style5"><FONT SIZE="3" class="auto-style4">Why, then, do so many fuss about precise translation?            They want to eliminate doubt, to establish a firm foundation            from which to build. Translation, however, can take you only            <I>near</I> the mark. In the end, it is the witness of the Spirit            that confirms Truth; for the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth.            The original, liturgical Hebrew language is oracular, and speaks            directly to the mind, free of verbal limitations; and the mind            finds the right words for the moment. For most, the oracular            Torah is the book that has been sealed. It was sealed on Earth            by the ciphers of Ezra, and it is confirmed as unsealed by the            discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which returns the Hebrew scriptures            to their original script. For some time on Earth (in fulfillment            of what is known as &quot;the effect of every vision.&quot; those            seals are witnessed by contemporary man to be opening. The veils            are being lifted. Wit this book and by this website, the consciousness            of man is hereby provided with the Key of David: Adam Kadmon--            The Tree of Life-- scaled to the dimensions of Noah's Ark. When            applied to the Shield of David, the Key displays the grid by            which the Holy Language of Elohim is communicated to the Sons            of Man. Reading thereby, there are countless books that would            spring from Torah: should they be written, every one, the world            would.</FONT></p>			<p class="auto-style5">Quench not the spirit.</p>			<p class="auto-style5">Yet, there are some who fear that no scripture            is of any private interpretation, thereby limiting the interpretation            of the individual.</p>			<p class="auto-style5">The key word, here is ANY! For 			interpretations belong to			<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style6">,            who gives of them freely, as needs and questions arise in the            hearts and minds of supplicants.</p>			<p class="auto-style5">I didn't cite Exodus 20:4-6, Torah's specific            instruction concerning graven images, for a number of reasons.            I will quote it, here, from the King James:</p>            <BLOCKQUOTE>              <ADDRESS><FONT COLOR="#000000">4 Thou shalt not make unto thee              any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven              above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water              under the earth: 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor              serve them: for I&nbsp;				  <img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style6"> thy God am a jealous God, visiting              the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third              and fourth generation of them that hate me; 6 And showing mercy              unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</FONT></ADDRESS>              <ADDRESS class="auto-style103">&nbsp;</ADDRESS>            </BLOCKQUOTE>            <p class="auto-style5">Do not make of Adam Kadmon what it is not.            It's a pattern.</p>			<p class="auto-style5">			<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style6"> must be central to your thoughts.

Every verse of Torah speaks to what is 			happening within you, within each of us. Every word locates dead 			center in each one of us. The highest interpretations are always 			those that apply to the individual human being as he is wooed and 			courted by his Maker. Do not construe an interpretation or an 			application: do not carve them out of the possibilities you see in 			your mind. Let			<img alt="" height="18" src="hwhy.10.ser.gif" width="50" class="auto-style6"> carve them for you.</p>			<p class="auto-style5">And there is no single correct interpretation.            Good heavens! Can you imagine reading the eternal Torah forever            if it means only one single thing?
