		<p>God is "Spirit." From both the Hebrew and the Greek canons, the most 
		common word translated as "spirit" has other, less nebulous definitions: 
		most notably, 
		"breath": God is Breath. Not "breathing," breath is the 
		reason we breath: we breathe the 
		Breath; for the Breath of Life hides behind the interplay of the inhale and the 
		exhale, supporting life in creatures that breathe. As the children of God, we breathe in God's Life, 
		his Essence; and we exhale 
		the savor of our utilizations of that Life. </p>
		<p>God's jealousy, that we should focus on none other, is not petty. The 
		Life Breath is without rival in each of us, and HaShem is jealous of our attention 
		not only for our survival, but for the quality of the lives we lead. To 
		focus on breath in the throes of whatever is happening in the moments of 
		our lives enriches the experience of Life and empowers both body and 
		mind. Focus on Breath is congruent with the way of Zen. 
		Elohim, the gods, the faces/attributes of the Holy One of

		<a href="../Dict/y/yh_yz/yh.html">Y<span class="auto-style96">H</span></a> ]} is 
		jealous of our attention because of love, not because of any 
		need for worship, but because cognizant utilization of the Life Breath 
		allows us to share the fullness of God's endless bounty. In whatsoever 
		we do, we should remember the Breath that makes action and reaction 
		possible.</p>
		<p>We are called to worship, not in awe of God's power, but in answer to 
		his love; for worship is the spontaneous response of the beloved to 
		love's Source. Worship requires no words, no piety. It requires 
		attention. Worship is the natural response of a living soul that has discovered the 
		Faces of HaShem written upon his own faces. To focus on breath trains 
		the mind to measure God's attributes, expressions, impulses, and 
		responses in all that we do; and it gives us ears to hear and eyes to 
		see. We are not to fear, 
		therefore; for God is no stranger, but is the intimate Presence within 
		each of us. It's not possible to worship God if we are afraid of God, 
		imagining deity to be some distant, outward reality. The 
		thundering voice of Sinai is the schoolmaster that prepares us to 
		receive and to hear and to understand the still, small voice that 
		provides counsel in our hearts.</p>
		<p>God's work is a strange work. He speaks to sinner ("once") and saint 
		(yes, "twice") by the same 
		Word; and we fail to perceive the message 
		so long as we apply understandings outwardly. The Hebrew and the Greek canons agree that both sinners 
		and saints are guilty of sin--of error. The difference between the 
		called and the chosen, is acknowledgment. Walking humbly with the 
		Breath, we can perceive sinner and saint as one. We are to consider the 
		sayings concerning the covenant between Heaven and Earth, not in 
		judgment of others or ourselves, but as words that will lead to our 
		understanding of the 
		righteousness of God, who is lifting the Creation he began in us to the 
		perfection he envisioned from the beginning.</p>
		<p>Beyond being petty, to question God's righteousness in the spirit of 
		accusation is unnecessary and counterproductive. Whatever our response 
		to our station in life, we all want to know what God is doing with us. Whatever 
		we might think of it, we arise each morning in the embrace of God's open arms or 
		struggles against the outstretched hand. Each day belongs to HaShem, and 
		we are to rejoice and be glad; for our lives are not our own.</p>
		<p>Any definition of God by means of words, sacred geometry, or artistic 
		portrayal is idolatrous. Every isolated thought we have about God is 
		idolatrous. The Breath is infinite and elsewhere. Where is the house we 
		might build unto God? The words, that might be adequate to convey our 
		understandings? To define God is to cast our gold (knowledge) and silver 
		(understandings) into the fires of our lives to chase after idols. It is 
		the interplay of Spirit and spirit-- of God's Face upon our faces-- that makes 
		knowledge of his righteousness possible. It is therefore written, 
		"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek, and lowly of 
		heart." God does not intrude. Although he is the Life that is in us and 
		there is no other, he knocks patiently upon the doors of our hearts from 
		within our hearts, awaiting invitation to join his counsel with our thoughts, so 
		that we can reason together. To sense his Presence within and to call 
		upon that Presence to arise is true worship and will lead to <em>
		kundalini</em>, the yoga of 
		seeing God as he is, not as we imagine him to be.</p>
