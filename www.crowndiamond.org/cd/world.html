			<span class="auto-style33">The </span><span class="auto-style39">Black Text</span><span class="auto-style33">-- the literal sense
            of the letter-- is for pilgrims hoping to find relief from personal
            confusion or troubles. Whatever translation such students examine,
            they encounter apparent inconsistencies within the text, even
            obvious contradictions. For example, the prophet instructs that
            HaShem says, in one context, not to kill/murder, and then orders
            what appears to be merciless genocide in another, without reference
            to the enduring mercy of 
			Y</span></FONT><span class="auto-style33"><span class="auto-style43">HWH</span>. Resolutions to such enigmas exist, but early struggle
            with the intricacies of the letter is likely to lead a student
            to one of two outcomes: either the individual will reject the
            entire text as nonsense, or else he will forego judgment and
            begin to ask the questions that will put him on the path to recovery
            of those dimensions of life lost through error.</span></P>
            <P class="auto-style37">No student is alone when reading scripture.
            HaShem is the Watcher and is jealous for the welfare of all who
            inquire at words first planted in the hearts of men to whom He
            gave eyes to see and ears to hear. Study of holy writ is a subtle
            dance between the human and divine spirits; and if HaShem leads
            in the circling of life, the issues of the Black Text ultimately
            trigger a questioning of the meaning of the Names it contains--
            a desire to establish real definitions, rather than an acquiescence
            to lazy acceptance of first impressions that meant very little.</P>
            <P class="auto-style37">Persevering in study, realization of the
            importance of Names in biblical accounts is inevitable; because
            the &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; is better understood from the
            Hebrew as the &quot;Kingdom of Names.&quot; The prayer, &quot;thy
            kingdom come,&quot; is equivalent to the prayer, &quot;that they
            may be One, as we are One&quot;; for all of us who struggle in
            the dimensions of earthly names are also known by the heavenly
            Names by which we were fashioned before our incarnations into
            earthly bodies, and as we walk the path leading to our celestial
            bodies, the mortal dimensions to which we adhere will be swallowed
            up in the emergence and confirmation of our heavenly Names.</P>
            <P class="auto-style27"><span class="auto-style33">As Yahush&uacute;a is the Word of HaShem from
            the beginning, we are the Words of HaShem that fell to the ground;
            and none of us shall have fallen in vain. All Names invested
            in the flesh/ground shall experience the Salvation of Yah as
            the will of HaShem is accomplished in its time: that will being
            that none should perish, rather that his Word will ultimately
            accomplish what is intended and required within each of us. The
            body of Yahush&uacute;a HaMashiyach-- the composite Temple of the 
			Spirit of Y<span class="auto-style43">HWH</span>,
            which is comprised of </span><span class="auto-style41">all</span><span class="auto-style33"> humanity, in its perfection:
            the holy nation of Y'Shar-AL, the firstborn, will be filled with
            the glory of HaShem/The Name, as 
			Y<span class="auto-style43">HWH</span> takes His rest upon the mercy seats we carry within
            our hearts.</span></P>
			<P class="auto-style27"><FONT SIZE="-1" class="auto-style44">
			<span class="auto-style33">The unfolding meanings of biblical Names open
            the sub-texts that are embedded as hidden stories within the
            letter of scripture. Layer upon layer as the sub-texts reveal
            themselves, the impacts of Names lead to increasingly astonishing
            allegorical understandings. Students who discover the sub-textual
            layers of scripture are reading what is called the </span>
			<span class="auto-style39">White Text.</span><span class="auto-style33">
            The allegorical understandings derived from this level of study
            are a door to the hidden manna of which Y'Sh&uacute;a spoke;
            and as the White Text is understood, the process of interiorizing
            what is </span><span class="auto-style41">truly</span><span class="auto-style33"> written begins in earnest.</span></FONT></P>
			<P class="auto-style27"><span class="auto-style33">At the first level of study, the Black Text
            admonishes and corrects, driving human sensibilities with the
            questions it provokes. The second level is approached through
            faith, and its White Text opens doors leading to enormous spiritual
            benefits. It is at the third level of scriptural study, however,
            that the faces of 
			Y<span class="auto-style43">HWH</span> </span>
			<FONT SIZE="-1" class="auto-style44">
			<span class="auto-style33">truly begin to reveal themselves. The third level is the 
			</span><span class="auto-style39">Inward
            Text</span><span class="auto-style33"> and consists of the conscious interplay between the
            Black and White Texts that occurs within the heart and mind during
            the processes of interiorization. The Inward Text is characterized
            by interpretations and transformations, for it is the operation
            of HaShem's handiwork in the process of personal salvation. This
            third level is an intensely dynamic interplay between mankind
            and the Creator, as HaShem fulfills the role of Fatherhood: the
            Inward Text is the level of the written word's interior relevance
            and application, and its purposes are healing and regeneration.</span></FONT></P>
			<P class="auto-style27">&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="-1" class="auto-style44"><span class="auto-style33">So long as the zeal engendered by progress
            in previous levels does not interfere by puffing up imaginations
            inordinately, there is yet another level of scriptural understanding.
            The fourth level is the </span><span class="auto-style39">Invisible Text</span><span class="auto-style33">, which is unveiled
            by no other means than Ruach HaQodesh, the Holy Spirit. Intellect
            cannot approach it. The Invisible Text is written upon the heart
            by the hand of HaShem, and study will not reveal what is written
            there; for its lessons reside in the realm of inspiration. As
            the literal and allegorical understandings exert their perfect
            influence and effects within the souls of students, therefore,
            the mystical understandings of the Invisible Text begin to be
            administered by the outstretched hand of HaShem, beckoning the
            Children of Light to follow.</span></FONT></P>
            <P class="auto-style37">Teachers should be able to minister to their
            charges appropriately, as need requires, not denying the validity
            of any level; for, in truth, all levels are active in concurrence:
            as White Text expands understandings, the Black Text may need
            to reassert itself to restore balance. Further, it is written,
            &quot;Let no man despise thy youth,&quot; because prophecy may
            issue from the mouths of babes. All is subject to the will of
            HaShem. May none of us quench the Spirit as we speak of these
            things among ourselves, that the Word of HaShem may accomplish
            divine intent without the inexpedient burden of human interference.
            Let none of us challenge another with contradiction simply because
            his understandings have yet to reach the level at which we, ourselves,
            are being fed. We must strive to honor all faces of Truth. These
            words apply to understanding and discussion of all holy writ.
            We are brothers, all of us; and none of us has anything that
            he has not first received. We are to feed, not lead; and rightly
            so: for HaShem, alone, has the perspective to answer any need
            at every level.
