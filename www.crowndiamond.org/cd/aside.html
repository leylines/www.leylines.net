		<img class="auto-style111" height="250" src="3rds.3.gif" style="float: right" width="250" alt="dalet" longdesc="large dalet, deep navy blue"><span class="auto-style100">Aside:</span></strong></h2>

		Where Three Roads Meet</span></strong></h2>
<p class="auto-style107">Like so many, I was thoroughly indoctrinated by 
religion as a child. The particular 
brand doesn't much matter; for whatever beliefs are involved, religions are capitalizations of 
faith. The function of religion is preservation and promulgation of core values 
and beliefs while affording secular governance 
room to accommodate 
the material interests of the state. Generally speaking, the subtleties of 
doctrines are the business of initiates, while a majority of adherents are 
satisfied with surface meanings that hold keys to deeper understandings.</p>
<p class="auto-style107">The just walk by faith, not by 
the doctrines of society's 
belief systems. The paths of true believers and of simplistic practitioners cross 
in the minds of those called to make a choice of what direction their 
lives should take: the right-hand path or that of the left. While most stumble 
in indecision, the chosen are those who find the hidden path of the middle 
way, the way to perfection. </p>
<p class="auto-style107">Like the rich young ruler of the gospel parable, I had become spiritually bankrupt 
as a young adult. 
My mind had become cluttered with suppositions 
	and expectations that arose from doctrines that had been hammered into me 
from my youth. My concept of faith was that I was obligated to conform my life 
not to any spiritual reality, but to a set of expectations based on rules. I tried my 
best to live as I imagined faith required, failing so many times. It was embarrassing.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Like the young man who came to master 
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html" target="_blank">Y'shua</a>, asking what he must do to inherit eternal life, 
my mind was cluttered with religious suppositions-- with righteous mammon, the 
teachings I had stored away in my heart and mind. Years after I had disassociated myself from any organized religion, 
however, it 
was given to me to take 
a first step along the 
	transcendental path of the Spirit. God calls whom he will, when he will; and, 
having been surreptitiously "called" without much thought about what was going on, 
there came a day when I found myself , quite literally, walking out of my city apartment and away from all 
and everyone I knew. 
</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">I had only a vague sense of what I was doing (a 
subconscious awareness of the influence of the religious training I had rejected), but 
the grace of God was sufficient for each 
day on the homeless road. Wandering about, here and there, I had much plans. The 
story of the journey that led to the Crown Diamond revelation is written
<a href="sephiroth.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Simultaneously with the revelation, I was led 
to the companionship of two spiritual men with their own visions, and the three 
of us spurred each other along our separate paths.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">On the threshold of a new understanding of scripture and the ways of 
		<span class="auto-style110">hy</span>, I was led by the 
	Inward Breath into a close relationship with Michael Murphy, a student of both Jewish and Christian kabbalah, or "qabalah," as it is sometimes rendered into English. 
Understood as "tradition," kabbalah is the study of the oral, apocryphal, and 
pseudepigraphical traditions of the remnant, from the time of Moses to the 
present; and most kabbalistic works evidence a great reverence for the accepted, 
written canons, and for all teachings in which they perceive faces of Truth.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Shortly after meeting Michael and his family, I 
		was led to friendship with Shmuel Wahli, a gifted student of messianic 
		Judaism. A <em>shaliach</em>--one sent for a specific spiritual purpose, Shmuel's 
		work is centered on understandings derived from knowledge of Sinaitic 
		Hebrew. Paleo, as it is called, became a key element in my spiritual 
		progress, also; and much of my work is a direct result of Shmuel's 
		influence.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Called to interact with brothers whose perceptions and understandings 
were different and beyond my own, I was like a tree whose growth was influenced 
and enhanced by grafted knowledge from these two new friends. As our 
relationships developed, we each kept to the work to which each had been called, 
but our interactions took each of us beyond the comforts of individual thought. </p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Because there was no 
hostility between the three of us, we found common ground to work together for a number of years. 
		Both Michael and Shmuel were writing, and I had been trained as an 
		editor; so I volunteered to help with their work, which contributed 
		greatly to my education. From the beginning of our time together, we found ourselves 
		functioning in 
a place where three roads 
meet: not at Kether, but at Yesod, at Foundation.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Our spiritual lives were blessed by the amplification 
that builds upon 
cautious enthusiasm; and as the individual works with which each of us was tasked 
gained greater definition because of our work together, each of us was energized by 
expanding implications. Our individual points of view were ratified and 
augmented because their substances were caught up and swept 
along together within the energy generated by our loose collaboration. We influenced each other, but each of us carried the burden of his own soul as we 
traveled our separate paths in the service of the same Reality. The three<span class="auto-style69"> 
g </span>of us, each in his way, served the fourth among us, the Door<span class="auto-style69"> 
d</span>&nbsp; 
		to the 
Way, Truth, and Life of Father
<span class="auto-style69"><span class="auto-style110">hy</span></span>.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Sharing each other's burdens, Michael learned 
how to organize material into books; and his last book is preserved at a website 
maintained by his family and friends after his passing. It's online 
<a href="http://www.revelation2seven.org" target="_blank">
		here</a>. 
Shmuel was 
<img class="auto-style112" height="72" src="bible.gif" style="float: right" width="144" alt="open bible">considering abandoning the study of 
		<a href="torah.html">Sinaitic Hebrew</a>, but he 
was persuaded of its importance; and I served as the unofficial editor of 
Bet HaShem publications for many years without ever joining the Midrash. While 
there, I designed the organizational framework for early editions of the BHM Dictionary. The 
first edition is online
<a href="../public/Dictionaries/BHM.dictionary.1stEd.pdf" target="_blank">
		here</a>.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">Shmuel's works have 
been quite prolific since Michael passed and I was called to other things. Although the three of us 
were good friends and shared knowledge, we 
didn't always agree with each other's work. Brothers are for adversity, whether 
		to toughen each other up or to share strength in times of trial. As 
		individuals, each of us was made stronger by what we were able to share. Shmuel's latest works are available at 
the BHM website, which is online 
		<a href="http://www.bethashem.org" target="_blank">
		here</a>.</p>
		<p class="auto-style107">We stood together without conspiracy at an intersection of three roads. The 
intersection was Yesod, as noted; and, as consequence, those roads were 
diverging, not meeting. When we turned from each other after a number of 
years, each of us was 
stronger, better prepared for his individual walk in the steps of Y'shua. </p>
		<p class="auto-style107">The heavenly Father had particular visions for each 
of us: not 
fantasies we might have carved out on our own by laying field to field, thought 
		to thought, leaving no room for others. 
		Separated unto our callings and services within the 
Kingdom of God, we fellowshipped in peace, one with the other, supping 
together at the Master's table. The place where three roads meet has involved 
separate journeys for each of us, but each of us found himself strengthened and edified by 
		labor shared for the coming Kingdom of Names. I'm confident that Kether will find us standing 
together again, at the last day.</p>
