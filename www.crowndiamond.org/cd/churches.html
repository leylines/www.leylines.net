		<td class="auto-style119">The Light that Enlightens Everyone&nbsp;Addressing those born 
		of the Breath, Yahushúa speaks of the angels and also of the stars of 
		the seven Churches of Asia. The gospels turned the world upside down, 
		proclaiming that the roots of mankind are in Heaven, not on Earth, and 
		that, in the company of angels, man beholds the faces of the Father, 
		continually. This revelation means that mankind is "a little lower" than 
		the angels in that, by incarnation, they put on mortality: they humbled 
		themselves to enter 
				<a href="worm.html">cocoons</a> made of dust that would, after many cycles, 
		earn them the celestial bodies of immortals. Man's mantle of dust is the 
		swaddling clothes of stars; for angels are worms of heavenly fire, 
		rising and falling within the Lake of Fire that surrounds the throne of 
		Heaven. Angels seek the stability of permanence in perfection, and they 
		choose to live and die as men until they stand before the Father without 
		spot or blemish.<br class="auto-style103">
				<br class="auto-style103">The human child is a worm of star-fire energies 
		that are bundled into centers within the physical body. These spiritual 
		energies are given in support of Life; for the physical body has no life 
		of its own. Like the natural fires of Earth, these stellar life energies 
		would climb out of control, were they not anchored in the body by the 
		will of God through the agency of Immanu<span class="auto-style131">AL</span>, God's hidden Presence within 
		each of us; for in him we live and move and have our being. To speak of 
		God's faces, giving them names, tends to elevate one aspect of 
		the Godhead above another. The foolishness of defining and clarifying 
		what we understand about the nature of God is well-intended, and 
		honorable, for that reason; but we do well to remember that such 
		definitions tend towards idolatry. Y<span class="auto-style103">HWH</span> is one
				<span class="auto-style130">hwhy</span>, 
		and preoccupation with perceiving his features must bow to our glimpses 
		of the whole.<br class="auto-style103"><br class="auto-style103">
				The seats of Divine Spirit within the human 
		tabernacle are known in systems of the East as 
				<a href="hindic4.gif">chakras</a>, which are 
		situated on specific areas of the spinal column. As a rule, 
		practitioners of the Eastern systems seek quietude, by which their 
		spirits can experience a release of the energy known as kundalini, which 
		can carry a soul beyond the realms of illusion to an eighth chakra, 
		called nirvana, a state in which disturbance does not exist. <br>
		<span class="auto-style119"><br>The 
		comparable Western system is kabbalah, whose goal, by tradition, is 
		bliss through knowledge. In practice, meditation clears the mind, so 
		that accurate analysis of spiritual reality is possible. The chakras are 
		seen as perspectives within the spheres; and three centers are binary, 
		in recognition of the duality that 
		accompanies developing thoughts. 
		Seven levels within ten sephiroth open the door to transformation, but 
		an eleventh sphere, called Knowledge, stores perceptions of the 
		ineffable realm of <em>Ain Soph</em>, the realm the Creator enjoys beyond 
		Creation.<br class="auto-style103"><br class="auto-style103">
				I've only a general understanding of the prevalent 
		mystical systems of East and West and apologize for misrepresentation. 
		Although the information they codify can be pivotal in spiritual growth, 
		systems only reflect interior realities. 
		My sense, however, is that the messages to the Churches of Asia have a 
		distinctly different intent. Though reward is featured in the texts, 
		transcendence or mastery are not primary goals. The overpowering message 
		is a call for partnership, whose purpose is, ultimately, the redemption 
		of all mankind.<br class="auto-style103">
				<br class="auto-style103">To overcome in Asia is to dismiss constraints of 
		logic and, by faith, to walk the earth, not only in the steps of the 
		Master of Heaven, but <em>as</em> the master of heaven: that is to say, 
		by doing his will by 
		performing his works as they are delivered into one's hands. The gospels 
		turned the world upside down. Righteousness is not a 
		<img height="182" src="cit.ad2.gif" style="float: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px" width="180">question of what 
		one does, but of why one does what he does. He who does not gather with 
		the Master of Heaven scatters. <br class="auto-style103">
				<br class="auto-style103">To avoid the ditch into which a 
		brother has fallen for fear of soiling oneself is to incur blood guilt. 
		If we say we have no error, we deceive ourselves; and Truth is not in 
		us. It is not for us to choose what error we allow and what we disallow. 
		In faith, we are to offer ourselves a willing sacrifice as we surrender 
		willful understandings to the guidance of the Master Shepherd. That 
		being said, let no man lay a hand on another, lightly. We heal by the 
		laying on of hands: our grip must be empowered by the guiding hand of 
				<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/Matthew/matthew2.html">Yahushua</a>. 
				<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shua</a> declared, "I, by myself, can do nothing," praying that 
		Father would send workers for the harvest. If we would join in the work, 
		we do well to remember that we serve.<br class="auto-style103">
				<br class="auto-style103">For this reason, the 
		twenty-four Elders cast their crowns before the throne, demanding, "how 
		long"? And to that end, the saints groan in their spirits, awaiting the 
		appearance on Earth of the Sons of God, the remnant of 144,000 souls 
		ready and willing to do God's work on Skid Row and in the synagogues at 
		the head of every corner throughout the world: not by crusade or 
		revival, but in accordance with what they are shown of and by the Father 
		of us all, which will be sufficient unto the day.  
				<br class="auto-style103"><br class="auto-style103">
				The messages 
		to the Churches of Asia are of another order, altogether, than the 
		testimonial gospels or the organizational epistles. The Master is 
		demanding discipline, but not for the sake of believers, but on behalf 
		of those who have been blinded to reason for belief by those who mouth 
		the words of holy ways without demonstrating those ways in their daily 
		lives, as it is written, "because of them, the way of Truth is evil 
		spoken of."<br><br>Commentary follows the message to the angel seated 
		within each of the
