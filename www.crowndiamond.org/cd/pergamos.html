		<p class="auto-style115">&nbsp;Take 
		my yoke upon thee, and learn of me<span class="auto-style131"> </span></p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><em>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he 
		which hath the sharp sword with two edges; I know thy works and where 
		thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my 
		name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas 
		was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.<br>
		<br>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them 
		that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling 
		block before the children of Yisrael, to eat things sacrificed unto 
		idols, and to commit fornication. So hast thou also them that hold the 
		doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. Repent; or else I will 
		come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my 
		mouth.<br><br>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith 
		unto the churches; To him that 
		<a href="yisrael.gif">overcometh</a> will I give to eat of the 
		hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new 
		name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</em></p>
		</strong>
		<p class="auto-style123">Satan is the prince of the power of the 
		air, the covering cherub of <br class="auto-style123">the governing forces of instability. A ruler 
		of the second heaven (the first heaven is the mind of man), the 
		adversary gains entrance into
		<a href="adam.html">Adam</a>-- into the Temple of Elohim-- through 
		the use of air for speech; for we know both that it is not what goes 
		into a man that defiles him, but what comes out of him, and that death 
		and life are in the power of the tongue as a former of words. As the 
		exchange of air within the body is accomplished in the lungs, we 
		understand that they are constantly open to the spiritual element of 
		air-- dwelling, in a sense, within it; and the animal mind is 
		ever-mindful of their operations; for the capacity of natural breath is 
		a significant bridle on human will.
		<p class="auto-style123">Even as the firmament is the dividing line 
		between waters above and waters below, the lungs are that bodily region 
		in which one senses the line of demarcation between the higher and the 
		lower faculties. In their lower function, the lungs supply oxygen to the 
		body's metabolic fires; in their higher function, they are the bellows 
		that fan the fires of the lips. In the more elevated service, however, 
		the lungs supply only the raw material necessary for speech: yet higher 
		faculties mold their contribution into intelligent sounds. Nevertheless, 
		it is in the lungs, as in the firmament, that we begin to differentiate 
		between things above and things below.<br class="auto-style123">&nbsp;<br class="auto-style123">
		The overwhelming focus of the message to the angel of Pergamos 
		is the power of speech. 
		<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/Matthew/matthew2.html">Yahushúa</a> appears in his role as Spokesman, 
		reminding us that his words are of a different order than our own (they 
		are Spirit, and they are Life): because by him is enunciated the Living 
		Word of Elohim. As the message proceeds, moreover, it compels us to 
		recall the importance of the intricacies of oral communication in all 
		contexts-- both as concerns the revelations of 
		<a href="torah.html">Torah</a>, of revelations yet 
		to come, while not overlooking the significance of our casual 
		conversations; for every word shall be measured and judged for its 
		spiritual impact within the social order. We are brethren.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">The church at Pergamos is comprised of the binary 
		light of Netsach (Endurance) and Hod (Majesty). This dualism is apparent 
		in the function of the lungs, whose unity of operation in man as flesh 
		is well known to all. This third light of the Menorah has yet other 
		traditional names, which speak more openly of their significance in the 
		complete Adam. The spheres are also known, respectively, as the Remnant 
		(the Body) and as Messiah (Spirit). We could apply to them yet other 
		names that answer to the binary principle understood in the traditional 
		names, bringing their relevance loser to the context of the message at 
		Pergamos-- for example, the disciples and the Apostle. the congregation 
		and the minister, and so forth. </p>
		<p class="auto-style123">Overcoming in Malkuth and Yesod, the pilgrim in 
		Mashiyach has yet many way stations on his journey to perfection. As he 
		approaches Netsach and Hod, which are representative of the collective 
		Body of Messiah, there are forks in the road and choices to be made. 
		Shall he continue to walk in the Light he has <a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/__MACOSX">
		<img height="182" src="cit.per.gif" style="float: left; border-width: 0px; margin: 3px 34px" width="200" class="auto-style123"></a>known, or shall he turn 
		aside to the other lights he perceives? The message to the angel of 
		<a href="smyrna.html">Smyrna</a> has prepared him for the choice, but it remains a difficult 
		decision-- especially as all spheres affirm the Light he has known, 
		albeit with different hues.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">Though he invites destruction by choosing for 
		himself either the right- or the left-hand path (in which case, he risks 
		being led not by the Spirit, but by the reasonings of the carnal mind-- 
		a way that seems right to man), the pilgrim positively invokes 
		destruction by judging those stationed in the spheres to which the 
		branching paths lead as being contrary to Messiah: for as he judges, he 
		will be judged; and he, himself, may be called to serve either in a 
		congregation or as minister to a congregation, whether of one sort or of 
		another. He will certainly be called to take some position in the Body. 
		Before a pilgrim can find his proper place and function in the Church, 
		therefore, he must overcome in Pergamos, that his mind will be ordered 
		correctly to interpret meanings and to discern sources of the mixed 
		sounds that will continue to fill the air therein as the Body moves 
		towards the perfection of maturity.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">The <a href="moon.html">Foreword</a> of this book deals with the 
		difficulty of assessing the value and source of words spoken on behalf 
		of the Kingdom of Elohim. To overcome in Pergamos is to learn the 
		application of the messages to Smyrna and Ephesus. Focused in the single 
		Light shining in all of God's Sons, we do not stumble because of its 
		apparent movements among them. At one moment, a man's words seem true; 
		at another, false-- what of it! Seek and serve the Light of Ruach 
		haElohim. It may be necessary for another, truly serving that Light, to 
		appear as a deceiver (while he, himself, remains true), that the focus 
		of an immature brother may be restored to the Source.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">Though we have ten thousand instructors in 
		Messiah, yet we have not many fathers. Learn to hear the Father's voice 
		from within the Body, that you may come both to hear and to speak in his 
		power: not as the seer Balaam, who heard as from without and long 
		remained deaf to the significance of that which was spoken unto him, 
		agreeing with Balac that another altar in another time at another place 
		might give other counsel.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">A brother's words are received as clean only as 
		they are heard and understood in Messiah. To hear in a focus that 
		celebrates the individual is to eat things sacrificed to idols and to 
		commit fornication, whether or not the words were spoken to that intent. 
		See thou do it not: worship Elohim, and have fellowship with thy fellow 
		servants who have the testimony of Yahushúa.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">Manna-- literally, "a what-ness"-- what is it? It 
		is likened unto a little, white pebble: to a clean word with which to 
		nourish the growing Celestial Body, not unlike the stone used by Dawid 
		to restore faith in<br class="auto-style123">Y'Shar<span class="auto-style150">al</span>, whose covering of faith had been severely 
		threatened by the boastings of Goliath.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">There is a tradition that the written word of 
		Torah, whose books are sometimes called "The Five Stones," is black fire 
		upon white fire (as it is written, "He will magnify the law, and make it 
		honorable"). In this context, manna is the white fire of Spirit 
		surrounding every jot and tittle of Tanakh. The fullness of the names 
		written therein are known only to those to whom the Fire of Heaven is 
		given; and thus, He who overcomes receives a baptism of fire.</p>
		<p class="auto-style123">Until the fullness of that day comes, let us 
		rest, as we are given, in the Light emanating from the white fire of the 
		written Word, that-- wherever we find ourselves positioned in the 
		collective Body of Messiah-- we shall be prepared to move beyond 
		Pergamos on the center path as we are drawn by the Father unto 
		perfection in the Son. When Yahushúa returns to seal the firstfruits 
		with the baptism of fire, he shall arise from within the hearts of those 
		able to walk with him on the Mount of Understanding; and these shall 
		carry forth the heavenly fire of Torah to all people, armed with the 
		sweet savor of the Gospel of Truth.&nbsp;</p>
