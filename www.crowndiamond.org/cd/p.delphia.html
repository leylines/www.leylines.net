		<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 700" class="auto-style139">
		<em class="auto-style138">And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things 
		saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, 
		he that openeth and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; I 
		know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man 
		can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and 
		hast not denied my name.</em></p>
		<p style="font-weight: 700" class="auto-style153">
		<em class="auto-style1"><em class="auto-style138">&nbsp;Behold, I will 
		make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are 
		not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy

		<p style="font-weight: 700" class="auto-style152">
		<em class="auto-style1"><em class="auto-style138">&nbsp;Him that </em> <strong>
		<em class="auto-style138"><a href="yisrael.gif">overcometh</a> </em> </strong>
		<em class="auto-style138">will I make a pillar in the temple of

		name of my El, and the name of the city of my Elohim, which is the new Yahrushaliem, which cometh down out of heaven from my El: and I will 
		write upon him my new name. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the 
		Spirit saith unto the churches.</em></em></p>
		<p style="text-align: left; " class="auto-style1">The 
		street before him was covered with roses, lilies, flowers of every sort. 
		Not many could see these quiet messengers of the Lotus: their hues held 
		closely to the clear radiance of light, itself. But even those who could 
		not see their loveliness might admit that the sky was particularly 
		bright this morning-- as though the light slowed upon its destinations, 
		hanging in the air like spring water frozen in tiny jars of flawless 
		glass. Each step of his seemed to break the spell, sending silver 
		slivers of ice light skittering along from around the soles of his feet 
		to bruise the petals of the flowers, filling the air with precious 
		aromas.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left; " class="auto-style1">
		<img height="182" src="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/phillip.gif" style="float: left; margin: 7px 6px" width="200">And yet, it was quite an ordinary street. This block resembled a 
		boulevard; the next, an alleyway. Shops and empty tin cans, awnings and 
		lean-tos-- the passably ornate and the incidentally shabby blending 
		agreeably, unless one should be rude enough to inspect the scene more 
		closely than it deserved.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left; " class="auto-style1">
		<span class="auto-style1">He let the Spirit fill him to 
		overflowing, that in its overflow he might become One according to its 
		wisdom. Taller, he grew with each step; and smaller, also. A bend along 
		the way brought him face to face with the morning sun, and his hands 
		became as gloves; his feet, as shoes. His face had become as a window in 
		a 
		vast cloud of Spirit that filled the horizon as he walked, and from 
		its happy opening shone forth the Light that exceeds all radiance. As he 
		celebrated the presence of that Light within him in his walk, the force 
		of his footfalls united the cells in his body with the meanings of the 
		day.</span></p>
		<p style="text-align: left; " class="auto-style1">
		<span class="auto-style1">He came upon a vendor in the way and felt suddenly tired. 
		Knowing the fatigue was not his own, he stopped beside the man and 
		bought a cake for his breakfast. When the peddler returned his change, 
		he thanked him for being considerate enough to supply him with his 
		breakfast so early in the morning.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">As he busied himself with 
		preparing the cake to his liking, he could see that his host's spirits 
		had risen considerably already, and that a further supportive word would 
		not be without effect. As he prepared to take his leave, therefore, he 
		remarked that sleep is death to a sluggard; but to an industrious man, 
		it is health. The vendor smiled, and the monk reminded him that honest 
		smiles are rest to all men.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">He finished his breakfast cake not 
		far along the road and began to feel some nausea. "It would be foolish," 
		he thought, "to charge a vendor with so ready a smile with incompetence 
		or fraud in baking!" Deciding the cause of his discomfort must lie 
		elsewhere, the monk's attention fixed itself on a cantankerous old 
		fellow waiting impatiently along the edge of the road.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The man 
		was clearly upset. He was fussing back and forth along a treadmill of 
		his own making and was muttering incoherently of matters having no 
		apparent connection. He would stop abruptly and raise his arms, 
		fitfully, in a gesture apparently meaning, "Why me?" The monk noticed 
		that the man's arms never came above his waist.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">Although the 
		cause of this discomfort was not apparent to the monk, he reasoned that 
		it would help but little to know. The man was no stranger to this mood, 
		it was clear; and knowing the particulars of this appearance would only 
		muddle perception of the whole. The man was bound by an incapacity for 
		forgiveness of faults and failures-- whether real or imagined-- to which 
		he had been subjected by his fellows over the years. If he was no longer 
		able to forgive, after not being forgiven for so long, the monk 
		reasoned, the man might profit from being forgiven for nothing! Why not? 
		It would cost him nothing. He would give the man a seed of forgiveness! 
		If the man could receive it, he would begin to mend.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">As the monk 
		approached this aura of grumps and snaps and snarls in his resolve for 
		good, the angry man belched, looking somewhat bewildered. Immediately, 
		the monk's own stomach felt better, and he rejoiced in the knowledge 
		that the man was not beyond cure.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">"Good morning to you, sir! I'm 
		so sorry to have kept you waiting so long! Forgive me if I should not be 
		here tomorrow, at this time. There are so many hours in the day, you 
		know; and every one of them must be filled with something. Remember me 
		to your family; and good day to you, sir!" As he passed on by, it was as 
		though a pack of wolves was at his heels; but the monk was content-- 
		their fangs would clench harmlessly in the air of wonder.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">As the 
		monk neared his destination, the wind brought to his hearing sounds of 
		pleasant laughter. He thought to pass on by-- his friends were waiting 
		just beyond, in the place where three roads meet; but he realized that 
		every perception given to him in his journey was a part of his path, and 
		that he would as foolishly ignore the apparently careless as those 
		clearly in need of help.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">Deciding to heed this call also, he 
		found that the laughter came from a group of children playing a game of 
		marbles in the middle of the road. They were kneeling around a circle 
		they had drawn in the dust and were very absorbed with the positions of 
		the marbles within the circle. If he had not decided to stop, he might 
		easily have fallen over them.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">"What a wonderful game you're 
		having," he exclaimed! "My heart is truly blessed by your laughter. So 
		many children, nowadays, take themselves so seriously! No doubt, it is 
		because of the gravity of old-timers like me! I want to thank you for 
		enriching my life by your joy. But my thanks will not come for nothing! 
		Tell me, if you will, the secret of your game."<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The children 
		giggled somewhat at such a speech, but they were truly pleased by his 
		care of them. A furtive silence passed quickly around their circle and 
		seemed to settle on the smallest of them. The child got up from off his 
		knees and dusted off his trousers. Squinting up at the monk, he 
		answered, "No one wins."</span></p>
