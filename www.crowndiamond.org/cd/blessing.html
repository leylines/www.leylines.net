<p class="auto-style6"><span style="color: #000000;">Without the guidance of the Master Builder, reading scripture in its original language would be a most difficult challenge. The scriptural name </span>
<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/Dict/a/ab/aby.ulbwn.html">Abialbon</a><span style="color: #000000;"> suggests why this is not so. Each letter of the Ancient Hebrew <em>alefbet</em> is a symbol whose meanings and applications, when standing alone, are very broad. Wherever the mind turns its attention as it wrestles with the meanings of a word, each letter reflects the voice of HaShem as it speaks to the particular interior and exterior midset of the reader's soul, as pertains both to that reader's personal and social contexts and to the level of spiritual understanding the reader is capable of receiving at any given time.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style8">In reading the word-form letter combinations of Ancient Hebrew, therefore, a more focused understanding of the letters emerges; for the pairings narrow perceptions, bringing the message of the written word closer to particular ranges of concepts: only <em>closer</em>; for the word forms, like the letters themselves, address the mutable contexts into which they are received, both within and without. At any single reading, a word form brings messages to a reader's hearts that are targeted to the particular context of the moment. Reading scripture in its original script in the fulcrum of time would be an insupportable challenge, except for the influence of the words' immutable meanings as whispered within our hearts and minds by HaShem through the agency of Yahushua, the Projection of Yah's Salvation into created realms.</p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="color: #000000;">These whispers gave rise to the Oral Tradition received by the priests and prophets of old. The foundational meanings of scriptural word forms understood by the prophets all answer to a single immutable influence, the Name of HaShem; for it is written that Y<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span class="auto-style3">HWH</span></span> will magnify the written word <em>according</em> to (his) name: that HaShem will magnify Torah, making it honorable, for (his) Name's sake. Here a little and there a little therefore-- whether in the Hebrew translations of the Oral Tradition with which we are familiar, or in the vernacular translations of our native tongues, or in <em>Ketav Levonah</em>, the ancient letters of Light-- we must read scripture in the context of its foundation: the Name of HaShem, which projects the Salvation of Yah, its cornerstone.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; ">At any instant, the combined letters of scriptural word forms narrow temporal focus by virtue of the logic imposed by letter sequence, which moves mutable intellect towards equivalent verbal forms in the reader's secular language. The original Hebrew scriptures speak in the familiar words of the Oral Tradition, but they also murmur mysteries that reflect their ineffable cognitive imagery, as embedded in the writings of the prophets, and as whispered within the hearts and minds of readers: who, like the prophets before them, must testify to what they hear with stammering lips, using the tongues of the secular languages by which they communicate.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="color: #000000;">What follows is a temporal understanding of the blessing HaShem instructed Moshe to pronounce upon the children of Yisrael, the Spiritual Nation that has been arising within our hearts and minds throughout our history and is coming nearer and clearer with each day. Moshe/Moses/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hcm</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is the reflection of HaShem/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">mch</span><span style="color: #000000;">-- The/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Name/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">mc</span><span style="color: #000000;">: Moses and HaShem are mirror images of each other; for Moshe is a reflection/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">m</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of the wisdom/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">c</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that comes with enlightenment/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;">. The writings of Moshe are messages/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">m</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that stimulate/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">c</span><span style="color: #000000;"> discernment/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="color: #000000;">In HaShem-- in The Name Y</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span class="auto-style3">HWH</span></span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hwhy</span><span style="color: #000000;">-- two pairings are prominent: the Yod/He (</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hy</span><span style="color: #000000;">) and the Waw/He (</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hw</span><span style="color: #000000;">). In its structure and sequence, therefore, HaShem Y<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span class="auto-style3">HWH</span></span> is an implicit statement of covenant that speaks of the gift/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">y</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of enlightenment/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and the longing/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">w</span><span style="color: #000000;"> for enlightenment/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;">. The giving is stated before the longing is expressed, even as it is written that HaShem answers before (his) children call.; for HaShem is the Unity comprised of the Giver/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">y</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of Life/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> (Yah/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hy</span><span style="color: #000000;">) and the Sustainer/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">w</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of Life/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> (Wah//</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">wh</span><span style="color: #000000;">). The Giver of Life and the Nourisher of Life are one Spirit, even as the joining together of man and woman comprises one flesh. All things answer to the holy name, as testified by the man Y'Sh&uacute;a as he relayed the words of Yahush&uacute;a, the Projection/Son/Salvation of Yah. The yoke of Yah's salvation is easy; for (his) burden is Light.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="color: #000000;">As the children of HaShem read scripture according to The Name Y<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span class="auto-style3">HWH</span></span>, there is a giving/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">y</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of light/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that is coupled with an embrace/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">w</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of subsequent enlightenment/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> <span style="color: #000000;">There is a stimulation/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">y</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of discernment/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that is coupled with/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">w</span><span style="color: #000000;"> revelations/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;"> of scriptural meanings and applications. HaShem/The Name is the essence of the covenant made with mankind on the Mt. Sinai called Hagar and the Mt. Sinai called Y'Sh&uacute;a, and the Mt. Sinai that exists within the heart and mind of every human being.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="color: #000000;">The Name is a promise that Y<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'times new roman', times;"><span class="auto-style3">HWH</span></span> does not act without counterbalancing that action. Among many other things, this means that HaShem does not judge/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hy</span><span style="color: #000000;"> (the hand/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">y</span><span style="color: #000000;"> that holds the winnowing fan/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;">) without also extending mercy/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">hw</span><span style="color: #000000;"> (compassionate/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">w</span><span style="color: #000000;"> relief/</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: PaleoBora;">h</span><span style="color: #000000;">). These understandings are confirmed by the blessing Moshe was instructed to teach Aharon and (his) sons, for the benefit of the spiritual nation Am-Yisrael, the invisible Kingdom of Names/Heaven arising within our hearts and minds:</span></p>
