		<h2>Malkuth:</h2>
		<h1>The Church at Ephesus</h1>
		<p><strong>Take my yoke upon thee, and learn of me.</strong></p>
		<p class="auto-style2"><strong><em>Unto the angel of the church of 
		Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his 
		right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; I 
		know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not 
		bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are 
		apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: And hast borne, and 
		hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not 
		fainted; <br><br>
		Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou 
		hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou art 
		fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto 
		thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except 
		thou repent.<br><br>
		But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of 
		the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. He that hath an ear, let him hear 
		what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that 
		<a href="file:///D:/crowndiamond.org/cd/yisrael.gif">overcometh</a> will I 
		give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise 
		of Elohim.</em></strong><br></p>
		<p class="auto-style8">When Kether is the point of origin in study of 
		the 
		<a href="sephiroth.html">sephiroth</a>, Malkuth can be understood as fruition; but when Malkuth 
		is the beginning focus, the sphere is best understood as conception. 
		Visually, Kether and Malkuth appear to be positioned at opposite ends of 
		a continuum; whereas in fact, however, they are more like an alignment 
		of points located on a vast spiral; and the values represented by those 
		points-- their significances-- are determined chiefly by the direction 
		of approach in the illusory dynamics of time.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The linear aspect 
		of the inward journey from Malkuth to Kether is experienced by our 
		minds; the spiraling aspect, by our spirits. The kindred relationship 
		between the two spheres is understood even in their names: Malkuth is 
		translated as "Kingdom" and is often associated with the tribe of 
		Ephraim; Kether is rendered as "Crown," in association with Judah. 
		<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The journey from Malkuth to Kether, then, entails the reunification 
		of the broken sticks of the Davidic Kingdom. Ten (Malkuth) is, after 
		all, another level of One (Kether); and in various studies throughout 
		the centuries, several 
		<a href="adam.html">Adam Kadmons</a> have been stacked, one above 
		another, to signify progressive revelation, with Malkuth and Kether 
		interchanging at successive levels of symbolic thought. This tradition 
		recalls the Isaiah precept, HaShem's word to them was "here a little, 
		and there a little."<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">In the ascending progression, which moves 
		from thoughts of the created order to meditations upon the nature of 
		Elohim, the student advances from Malkuth to Kether, finding in Kether 
		insights that generate understanding that forms a new and richer 
		understanding of Malkuth, from which to begin again. In the descending 
		progression, which moves from conceptions of Elohim to conclusions on 
		the nature of his creation, Malkuth transforms into another order of 
		Kether-- into new understandings of Elohim.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">Using Malkuth as 
		point of departure, we focus upon revelations of the first Adam, as 
		known in our mortal tabernacles, seeking understanding of corollary 
		implications for the walk in the second Adam. The sephiroth are also 
		known as "emanations," or the pouring&nbsp; forth of Light. As Malkuth is the 
		root, or lowermost manifestation, of the Tree of Life, we consider our 
		bodies to discover the lower-most member responsible for the 
		manifestation of the physiological equivalent of light, or because of 
		which conscious, motivational thought is routinely generated, equating 
		that member, and its functions, with Malkuth.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">We adopt this 
		procedure because of the unity of scriptural imagery: the menorah, or 
		"candlestick," of the tabernacle of Moses is the prototype for both the 
		seven candlesticks of the message to the Churches of Asia and, in a 
		mystery, for the ten silver and ten golden candlesticks of the temple 
		built by Solomon.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The revelation to Moses is that these seven 
		lights are branches of one holder; the revelation to John the Revelator 
		is that the lights are perceived as functioning individually, being 
		united in the High Priest who both holds and moves among their lights, 
		and whose Father is the Light thereof.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">That it is possible for 
		the candlesticks to be removed out of their places (compare, "if thy 
		right eye offend thee"), connects this imagery loosely with Paul's 
		teachings on the wild (silver) branches and the natural (golden) 
		branches of the olive tree, a symbol of the Life Tree as revealed in 
		Man, the Temple of Elohim.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The wild olive's branches are the ten 
		silver candlesticks of Solomon's Temple, whose place was not specified 
		in that revelation. The natural olive's branches are the ten golden 
		candlesticks, which served to light the way into the holy of holies, 
		proper home of the true Menorah. In Messiah, both the wild and natural 
		olive branches are grafted into the true, Eternal Olive, the Tree of 
		Light, which Light is made visible by the Life in man.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">As there 
		is but one Church-- one Menorah, one united Olive Tree, one Body-- and 
		as the messages are sent to the seven churches that are in Asia, we 
		conclude that Asia, lair of the fabled Dragon, is a symbol of the 
		libidinal attributes of the flesh as measured in the astral plane, and 
		that the individual churches of Asia are symbolic of the energies 
		operative within the physical forms and faculties housed by the flesh-- 
		by body, by earth, by galaxy, by universe. The flesh may be weak, but it 
		is not unholy; for the flesh is also the Temple in which the spiritual 
		churches of Asia congregate to worship Elohim.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">
		<img height="182" src="cit.2eph.gif" style="float: left; margin: 7px 13px" width="200">When the messages 
		actually begin, moreover, it is not the churches, or body faculties, 
		that are addressed directly, but the angel of the church assembled at 
		each city, or dominion, of Asia. As the manifested existence of angels 
		is in heavenly realms, the angel of each church of Asia is interpreted 
		as being equivalent to that portion of the unconscious mind exercising 
		control or spiritual oversight upon the locale entrusted to its 
		supervision: upon those forms and faculties in its domain.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">That 
		the angels are addressed and that the churches are all invited to hear 
		interiorizes the teaching by Paul, "we wrestle not against flesh and 
		blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of 
		the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high 
		places." We do not imply that the angels of the churches of Asia are 
		wicked, but that they are subject to wickedness as they succumb to the 
		gravitational pull of lower, subterranean realms, forgetting their place 
		of origin and their ultimate destiny.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">The same judgment applies 
		to the forms and functions ministered to by the angels of the churches 
		of Asia as to the angels themselves: there is no wickedness in the flesh 
		itself, nor, necessarily, in the exercise of its faculties (as supposed 
		by the Nicolaitans, who practiced a rigid asceticism that indirectly 
		accuses the wisdom of the Creator in providing His creatures with such 
		troublesome dynamisms as are found in the flesh), but only in the uses 
		to which the flesh may be subjected at the instigation of a faulty will 
		or under the magnetism of a faulty inclination.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">Human will is a 
		faculty that operates as from below, and inclination is a force exerted 
		as from above. The ancient maxim applies: as above, so below; and, 
		inversely, as below, so above (compare 
		Matt. 18:18). The act of will is 
		answered by increase of inclination, whether according to the law of sin 
		unto death or to the law of redemption under grace unto eternal life.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">
		In his message to 
		Ephesus, 
		<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/Matthew/matthew2.html">Yahushúa</a> both commends and criticizes the fidelity of the 
		libidinal angel, speaking through him to the congregations of all of 
		Asia, which churches we have interpreted as representing the 
		<a href="first.html">collective 
		forms, functions, and faculties</a> of the human body. The roots of fidelity 
		among humans are found in the reproductive organs and the emotional and 
		intellectual complexes involved therein. The judgment, "thou hast left 
		thy first love," positions the axe head precisely at the root of the 
		Life Tree in each of us. This root is Malkuth, the bridal chamber.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">Even so, baptism into Messiah is as a wedding, 
		<a href="../Matthew/50messiah.html">making of twain a new 
		man</a>: wherefore they are no more two, but one flesh-- one Body. The 
		fruition of that union is as a birth-- the emergence of One. In birth, 
		the head is presented first, in the process called "crowning." Again, we 
		see the close relationship of the spheres Malkuth and Kether.<br class="auto-style132">
		<br class="auto-style132">If 
		we die daily to the isolation of sin that Messiah may be born anew in 
		us, we also are resurrected daily into His life. It is this daily 
		sacrifice of self and daily rebirth that builds faithfulness in the 
		chamber of Malkuth. As we renew fidelity in Ephesus, the allegiance of 
		the angel is assured; for he will be bound by the strength of proper 
		nourishment flowing into the Tree from its roots.</p>
