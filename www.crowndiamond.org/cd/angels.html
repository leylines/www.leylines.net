		<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
		As mere mortals in this present: made to be a little lower than the 
		immortal angels because of our 
		incursion into time, with its mortality, we cool the immortal fires of 
		angels within the temporal fires of Earth, invoking the Eternal Fire of the 
		Angel of the Presence for solace, friendship, and remedy. And cry out we do! Each of us pleads 
		his case, 
		consciously or not; for our faces-- the expressions inherent in our 
		faculties behold the 
		Faces of the heavenly Father, continually; and our spirits cast their crowns before 
		the Throne of Heaven and plead for understanding, accompanied by the 
		twenty-four perfected Elders, asking, "How long?!" </span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14">
		<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">Immanu</span><span class="auto-style15">AL</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; "> 
		has hidden in the hearts of mankind from the beginning, suffering every 
		pain and indignity as he prepares our angels for eternal life. Specs of 
		dust, here below, we are being readied to hold focus on the faces of the 
		Father as we navigate the whirls of galactic planets and stars in the 
		dynamics of a universe in the throes of Creation, its many mansions 
		being readied for our coming as Sons of Man.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14">
		<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">As 
		Immanu<span class="auto-style15">AL</span> has hidden in the thick darkness of human hearts since the 
		Garden expulsion, so long ago, so we have hidden beneath the 
		folds of the Father's wings, drawing from our covering courage to face the uproars of 
		mortal life, day after day and round after round. Yes, we live and die 
		as men incarnated in specks of dark dust; but where dust is, Light 
		becomes visible. And so, under the Father's watchful care across the 
		millennia, we develop into pearls of great price.</span></p>

		<img height="431" src="angels.gif" style="float: left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px" width="102">The 
		<a href="../Nod/Garden/adam.html">Adam</a> fashioned out of clay received the star seed of the Father's 
		Breath, and the second 
		<a href="../Nod/Adam/adam.html">Adam</a> was the first to carry that Breath to full 
		term: not by his birth in Bethlehem, the House of Battle, but through 
		overcoming in the prayer-closet isolation of the wilderness subsequent 
		to his immersion by 
		<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/genealogy.jpg">John Baptist</a>. Having yet to overcome before his 
		water baptism, he didn't go into the wilderness to get his life in 
		order, but to lay it down; for it was in the wilderness that he overcame 
		the temptations of logical pathways to mastery. In the secrecy of the 
		temple made without hands, he sacrificed all inward ambition and strife 
		on the altar of the Father's inward presence. Having made this acceptable 
		offering, he became the lynchpin of the age of the gospels, calling upon 
		each of us to follow in his footsteps on the path that leads to 
		perfection and eternal 
		Life.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14"><span class="auto-style16">It's t</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">he 
		Father that clothes us. Our success or failure in the trajectories of 
		our natural lives are the Father's doing, not our own. We make gestures, 
		which are accepted, or not. 
		<a href="file:///C:/Users/bfint/Documents/crowndiamond.org/Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shua</a>, Firstborn 
		of the Spirit, witnessed that he, by himself, could do nothing: not 
		good, nor bad, but nothing! To continue in the delusion that we are in 
		control of our lives is to make ourselves our own saviors, parting the Son's garments among ourselves 
		as we see fit, by 
		aligning ourselves not with the Whole, but with whatever attributes we 
		fancy. Thus, we fall into darker and darker dimensions, crucifying the 
		<a href="../Nod/Garden/pp10.html">Lord of Glory</a> in our own bodies.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
		When, again, the Father takes upon himself to draw our attention to the Son's forgiving knocks at our 
		hearts, we recognize the scarlet stain of our sins; and we realize that our eyes 
		sometimes become blind to revelation, and that our ears sometimes become deaf to 
		instruction, imprisoning us in the strange land of our vulnerabilities. </span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14"><span class="auto-style16">Do not despair of 
		receiving forgiveness after such falling away. God's mercy abides: it is 
		without end; and there shall be a way of escape. God is not mocked; and 
		a</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">s we shall 
		be given, we shall call upon the Father's name in the <em>position</em> of the Son; and 
		we will begin, again, to set aside our shackles the four-hundred 
		ninety-first time, to find ourselves welcomed with open 
		arms at an Ephesus we better understand, in continuation of our journey 
		home.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">The joy at 
		finding ourselves in 
		<a href="ephesus.html">Ephesus</a> is great; for we taste, again, of our 
		origins, having been brought near by the outpouring of grace. However, 
		we supposed that the vistas of this new land in 
		<a href="churches.html">Asia</a> were equal to those of
		<a href="yisrael.html">Y'Shar</a></span><span class="auto-style15"><a href="yisrael.html">AL</a></span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">; 
		and we became overjoyed beyond reason, forgetting yet again the 
		measurement of our first love. As we lost ourselves to celebration, our 
		focus blurred; our hearing became intermittent; and the Projection of 
		Yah became as a friend remembered, rather than an ever-present 
		companion.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style14"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">The falling 
		away-- at Ephesus or at 
		<a href="laodicea.html">Laodicea</a>-- brings waves of accusation; but wherever sin abounds, 
		grace shall triumph, because 
		<a href="yisrael.html">HaShem</a> is both Author of our faith and also 
		its Finisher. He does all thins well. Should we fall away yet again, therefore, the tender mercies 
		of HaShem shall cushion our downward momentum, beginning to lift us up again, 
		even as we continue in error.</span></p>
