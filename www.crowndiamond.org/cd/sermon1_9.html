<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">In 
this first sequential examination of the sephiroth, we will begin at Malkuth and 
will then circle around to Kether to proceed again towards Malkuth. This 
approach is not so disorderly as it might seem; a treatment of its basis in the 
traditions of kabbalah is given in the Malkuth text on the messages to the 
Churches of Asia.</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span class="auto-style71">
<img class="auto-style60" height="360" src="tbrncl.man.gif" style="float: right" width="142">The</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; "> 
purpose is to discover what the spheres have to add to our appreciation of 
Y'shúa's Sermon on the Mount, as recounted in Sephir MattíthYahu, the Book of 
Matthew. The little they might add to an understanding of these scriptures must 
not be gainsaid; for revelation is given by the littles.</span></p>
		<center><center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
What follows is a a cursory examination of these words: this interpretation is 
presented simply as an example of kabbalistic exegesis. To those who will think 
we make too much, in these pages, of numbers, whether stated or implied by 
quoted scriptures, I offer the reminder that even the hairs of our heads are 
numbered: it is not presumptuous, in consequence, to assume that the operation 
of numbers in scripture has special, intended significance. Overlooking this 
literal enforcement of the plausibility of this approach, let's begin.</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">The 
beatitudes of Saint Matthew are nine in number. As the sephiroth are ten, their 
relevance to the Sermon on the Mount is not immediately apparent. However, a 
tenth beatitude is hidden in the precepts beginning with Matthew 5:13 and 
continuing, minimally, through the end of Matthew 7, in the teaching of the wise 
man who both hears and performs the sayings of Y'shúa: as it is written in 
Revelation 22, "blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of this book." Kingdoms 
are ordered by the operation of law; and Malkuth, the manifestation of the 
Kingdom of Elohim, is ordered by the spiritual precepts of El, as they apply 
within the context of grace, which is the real-time mercy of HaShem.</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
Expressed otherwise, Y'shúa might have taught, "Blessed are they who shall hear 
the words of life and do them: for they shall dwell securely." It is rather 
wonderful, however, that he chose to hold a hidden blessing in reserve: some 
shall imagine themselves worthy of the nine, but shall be confounded by the 
tenth; so, also, shall some see themselves as unworthy in the nine, but shall, 
by the tenth blessing, be confirmed in all to all, as it is written, ". . . and 
the last, first."</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">I 
find yet another reason for no written, tenth beatitude in the Sermon on the 
Mount. Y'shúa teaches that the Kingdom-- Malkuth-- is like leaven hidden in 
measures of meal. Without digressing into interpretation of what these measures 
of meal might signify, we note that the blessing of the Kingdom is promised 
twice in the beatitudes. And why not three times: once for each measure of meal? 
Well, because the Kingdom is yet hidden until the full manifestation of the Sons 
of God; so, also, is the fullness of the Kingdom's blessings. The tenth blessing 
will be received with joy as the criteria for all blessings are confirmed within 
those who appear within the maturation of Malkuth: as it is written, "And in 
their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of 
El."</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">The 
precepts of the Sermon on the Mount are the distilled essence of Y'shúa's 
doctrinal gifts to the Kingdom-- they are the very fabric of the righteous 
mammon with which the Father has clothed him. To hold them in one's heart while 
reading all other scripture is to stand before an open door through which shines 
every nuance of sound interpretation.</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
Although they are of surpassing wisdom in every phrase, one nevertheless tends 
to receive them-- not without good reason-- into the contexts of personal states 
of being, remaining largely ignorant of those qualities of Light beyond the 
visible spectrum, as determined by an individual's capacity to receive. Because 
the beatitudes address themselves majestically to every spiritual state, one 
shouldn't construe their force at any reading to signal the limits of their 
application.</span></p>

			<span class="auto-style62">As perceive</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">d 
			in human terms, Kether is the sphere of Intelligence: it is the 
			crown given to man as signet of his dominion over all things of 
			Earth, from the beginning. Not only is intelligence the tool by 
			which man has subjugated the elements and lesser creatures to his 
			own will, often to his harm and shame, but it is also the faculty by 
			which man measures the movements of spirit within his own being: 
			both "the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the 
			beast that goeth downward to the earth."</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
From both the Greek and Hebrew scriptures, the words meaning "spirit" can be 
translated as "breath," or as "breeze." The two movements of spirit in the 
remarkable King James version of the Ecclesiastes parable, which are likened, as 
though in inversion, unto the exhale and the inhale of breath, are the contrary 
winds that drive the whirlwind of which Paul speaks in Romans 7.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
With an intelligence focused upon the power of the Breath of </span>
<span class="auto-style1">HWHY</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">, 
which dwells within the tabernacle of the mortal body in the position of the 
Son, man is able to quieten the contrary gusts of his spirit's lesser winds: he 
is able to impoverish them, denying their power over his mind and robbing them 
of their velocity. As one recognizes through meditation and chooses the still, 
small, ever-present voice of God's guiding Spirit within himself (those who seek 
shall find), he enters into rest-- into shabbat.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6">Able <span class="auto-style71">to hear </span>
<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">all things, now, in the 
peace that passes understanding, the Tabernacle Man can formulate thought and 
words that reach congruence with the powerful and productive inner calm of 
Matthew, Chapter 8. Meditation, which Paul calls "prayer without ceasing," 
reveals the interface between God's own, soundless voice as it resonates within 
the soul. The Presence of this interface is Messiah: once it is seen within, 
both Father and Son are perceived within, and the supplicant can no longer 
easily ask amiss, because he has opened unto the reality of the Kingdom of 
Elohim within his own soul.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">
This inward focus on the expressions of 
<span class="auto-style1">HWHY</span> is the mind found in Messiah Y'shúa. 
Allegiance to the operations of this mind in the Tabernacle Man puts to death 
the thieving carnal mind of the natural man through processes of transformation; 
and it opens the spiritual path to the full resurrection of Yahushúa within, as 
the outward paths of daily life unfold in the glorious freedom of the Sons of 
Elohim.</span></p>

Forgiveness, acceptance, and knowledge of the ways of Yah are the aim of

by receiving of the righteousness of Elohim. Mercy is given form as that 
righteousness from above is nurtured unto exterior manifestation upon its 
release into the realm of action, which is represented by Sephirah Din.</span></p>
		<center>
<p class="auto-style6"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; ">By 
our actions confirming the presence of God's righteousness in us, mercy is truly 
born in power: able to transform both the lives of those who give and those who 
receive; for as we do unto others, so shall it be done unto us-- both in this 
world, and in the age coming in the full stature of the manifestation of the 
Sons of El.</span></p>
