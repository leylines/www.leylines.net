		</span> </span><span class="auto-style61">(Gen. 2:7-9, 21-24)</span><span class="auto-style59">. She therefore 
		learned of the law from Adam by instruction, and not from Elohim by 
		direct revelation. As consequence, she may not have been able to understand the scope of Adam's report </span>
		<span class="auto-style61">(Is. 53)</span><span class="auto-style59">. Thus Adam, in his decision to share with her the death to come by also partaking of the forbidden fruit, rightly accepted responsibility for her deception.</span></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style30">
		The answer to the question by Elohim-- "What has thou done?"-- is not 
		fully answered by Adam's words, "I did eat," nor even by the apostle Paul's words concerning the significance of Adam's decision. 
		The answer has come by the littles through every word of scripture given unto man throughout the ages 
		and, no doubt, beyond: unto the farthest reaches of eternity. Adam had 
		sworn an oath, establishing 
		covenant with bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh; and by honoring 
		that agreement-- even against the faces of mortality: by agreeing to join Eve 
		in the process that would lead to their "full extension" (a Hebrew 
		concept of "death"), Adam and Eve became as sacrifices: the 
		praiseworthy progenitors of all mankind.</p>
		<p class="auto-style30">
		Before the separation of Eve from Adam, Adam walked with Elohim, thinking, "We are." He continued in 
		that awareness upon awakening to Eve's separation, including in that 
		mindset the additional thought, "Thou art also of us." In contrast, Eve was born to the thought, "Thou art; I am; we are; and God is." The dynamics of the Fall were therefore inherent in the 
		<em>processes</em> of creation itself, in that Creation necessitated awareness of self: 
		an awareness that, lingered upon, can be misconstrued as primacy of 
		self, opening mankind to the logical basis for the error of pride, which comes by forgetfulness of unity within the isolation of individuality.</p>

		in the blinking of an eye within the cocoon of reflective thought </span>

		Love of his own perfection, the sense of entitlement fostered by that 
		perversion of self-awareness, became Lucifer's undoing. Learn what this means, "I will have 
		mercy and not sacrifice"; for Satan, and the hosts of Amalek fathered by him in his ongoing conjunctions with man's perception of experience, 
		will be bound in the fullness of time by Y'sh&uacute;a's prayer, "that they may be One"
		</span></span><span class="auto-style61">(John 17:21)</span><span class="auto-style59">.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
		<p class="auto-style30"><span style="color: #000000;">
		<span class="auto-style61">The Second Adam triumphed over the inner adversary 
		(Matt. 4:1-11; Rev. 3:21; Col. 2:15)</span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="auto-style59"> by reconciling the deceived (Eve, the uncircumcised) and the not deceived (the

		<span class="auto-style61">(Eph. 2:11-16; Col. 2:10-13). Y'shúa's earthly walk unto his 
		own mortality in the triumph of his unity with Yahushua, the Angel of 
		the Presence, assures the ultimate salvation of Eve, as 
		the maligned First Adam is a figure of Messiah in Torah, and as Eve is a figure of his bride, the Church
		(Eph. 5:31-32; Rom. 7:14)</span></span><span style="color: #000000;" class="auto-style59">. United in the hidden faithfulness of

		<span class="auto-style61">(Rom. 1:20). The connecting lines of Adam Kadmon are symbolic of the organization, coordination, and communication of the body's members and faculties. The courtyards delineated by the connecting lines symbolize the unity of operation of connected spheres. The united order of the whole, then, symbolizes the physical body of man and speaks metaphorically of the spiritual body of

		As consequence, the sephiroth can be recognized and understood in every realm of investigation in every nominally secular sphere of human activity-- from speculative science to meal planning, whatever substantive difference there may be between them. Relentless scrutiny of man's endeavors discloses that the underlying reality of every assumption presumed as fact is faith.
