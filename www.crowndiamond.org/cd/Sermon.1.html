		<strong><span class="auto-style177">The Sermon on the Mount</span></strong><h2><strong><span class="auto-style89">Its Resonance within the Sephiroth</span></strong></h2>
		<p>
		<img height="42" src="sermon.gif" width="279"><br><strong>
		<span class="auto-style5">Matthew 5:3</span></strong></p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<p class="auto-style243">Almost hypnotic in cadence, the beatitudes of the Matthew gospel promise 
		the approval of God and the bounty of his Life Breath to 
		all whose souls honor divine principles. Not pleasantries or random thoughts, the 
		beatitudes address the seats and operations of the Father's Holy Spirit in each of us, stirring our 
		attention and arousing our hope. These teachings establish 
		guardrails for the path that leads to fulfillment of the Ten Sayings that 
		came through Moshe; and they were given to open our ears, that we might hear; to clarify our vision, that we might see; 
		and to soften our hearts, that we might be healed.<p class="auto-style243">
		Considered in light of the principles expressed in the beatitudes, the 
		ten sayings 
		of Moses are understood as holy prophecies that speak of God's love for 
		us, rather than as dictums to which we must adhere by exercise or 
		denial of personal will. When understood 
		as One, the voices of Moses, the prophets, and
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">the man</a> who is "called" the 
		messiah in Matthew 1:16, proclaim the same path to redemption.<p class="auto-style243">The two-edged sword of 
		scripture holds overtones of betrothal that are more 
		compelling than its warnings against 
		disobedience; and the simple words of the beatitudes, delivered on a lowly hill of Galilee, 
		drive that point home: into the very darkness of our hearts. 
		Strengthening us 
		as it gives us hope, the Sermon on the 
		Mount is a song whose chorus rings clearly with the 
		words, "I will have mercy, not sacrifice."<p class="auto-style243">
		<img height="182" src="cit.ad2.gif" style="float: right; margin: 7px 8px" width="180">When 
		the dark powers of <a href="howl.html">the nations</a> are driven out of souls, the
		attributes of the <a href="../Matthew/genealogy.html">Kingdom of Names</a> 
		arise within us as HaShem awakens those soul attributes that have been dreaming in darkness, arousing 
		them 
		from deep sleep by the light of the Morning Star. Already in the hearts 
		of the worst of us, 
		Heaven's kingdom has always been advancing against out conscious minds, 
		under the auspices of the hidden presence of Immanu<span class="auto-style93">AL</span>.<p class="auto-style243">
		At all times, through the depths and the heights of every moment of 
		every life, God's song of point and counterpoint calls upon us to enter 
		into the blessings stored up against the day <a href="../Matthew/Matthew2.html">Mashiyach <span class="auto-style93">owcwhy</span></a><span class="auto-style93"> </span> 
		<span class="auto-style260">shall </span>guide us into alignment with the will and principles of 
		Father 
		<span class="auto-style93">hy</span>.
		<p class="auto-style243">This study approaches the beatitudes as they relate to 
		Jacob's Ladder, the symbol of the Tree of&nbsp; Life. It begins with focus on 
		the sphere of Malkuth, which speaks of manifestation of the Kingdom of 
		HaShem,
		then shifts to a focus on postulations drawn from distant Kether, in 
		order to explore the context of the promised blessings. Personal 
		estimations of 
		paraneters are inadequate and, frankly, irrelevent. The beatitudes 
		encourage us to draw upon the righteousness of
		<span class="auto-style93">hwhy</span><span class="auto-style260"> for 
		guidance,</span><span class="auto-style237"> as we shall be enabled by 
		HaShem. Correct focus brings appropriate blessings.</span><p class="auto-style243">
		<span class="auto-style237"> To proceed with one eye focused on kether; 
		the other, on malkuth is not so disorderly as it seems. This bifurcated approach is&nbsp; elegantly set forth in the saying, "As above, so 
		below." However, there are pitfalls to this 
		dual focus, which are addressed by the prophets and affirmed in the message 
		delivered to the angel at <a href="ephesus.html">Ephesus</a>.</span><span class="auto-style236"> 
		The Churches of Asia, which house the seven candlesticks of the inward 
		menorah, are ignited by a single flame. We are heavenly worms of fire 
		buried in cocoons of flesh, and we will emerge</span> as moths 
		drawn by the comforting
		Light of Heaven, that we might alight without fear upon the hand of God 
		as it presses against our hearts. <p class="auto-style243">
		<img height="130" src="men.gif" style="float: left; " width="199">What, then, do we make of the night? As evenings come upon us, we trust that mornings will follow, 
		comforted in expectations of a new day. But what of the night? 
		If we find our paths have dead-ended in the land of Canaan, where we 
		find ourselves slain daily by inward swords, 
		we are forced to acknowledge what little we perceive of inward darkness, trusting the Father 
		to be faithful 
		to his promise to forgive and to cleanse. The holy war we must fight is 
		wholly within each of us. The combattants are the 
		twins wrestling within the spiritual womb we perceive as our lives, 
		which are truly hidden with HaShem. 
		Jihad is God's 
		war, not ours; and he must fight for us. Our role search out and welcome his victory. 
		The twins that war in the womb of the soul strengthen us against the 
		outward adversity 
		we encounter in our lives. In the holy war, we measure the spiritual
		darkness that presses upon inward conflict, longing for reconciliation and relief that will repair breaches, 
		turning the twins born of duality, making each his brother's keeper.<p class="auto-style243">
		This study is intended to examine what the lenses of kabbalah can add to appreciation of 
		the beatitudes. Whatever the sephiroth contribute to understanding such matters 
		is welcome; for revelation, we recall, is given by the "littles."
		<span class="auto-style186">I don't mean to suggest, therefore, that what follows is ground-breaking interpretation of the 
		gospel's words of
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shua</a>. To be scrupulously honest, 
		I rely upon the prayers of brethren who read these words, that struggles with this text not be in vain.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">To those who 
		think kabbalists make too much of imagery and numbers in scripture, whether 
		implied or explicitly stated, I offer reminder that the hairs of our heads are numbered, 
	a point to which the Essene Teacher of Righteousness gave cryptic emphasis. It's not presumptuous, 
		therefore, to 
		argue that the operation of numbers in the parables of scripture, stated 
		or implied, have purposeful, 
		intended significance.</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">The beattitudes recorded by 
		Saint Matthew are nine in number. As the sephiroth are ten, the 
		relevance of the nine blessings isn't immediately apparent. However, a tenth beatitude 
	is hidden in the precepts beginning with Matthew 5:13 and continuing, minimally, through the end of Matthew 7 in the teaching of the wise man who both hears and performs the sayings 
		that came by Y'shua. 
		This unstated, tenth beatitude is also affirmed in Revelation 22 by the words 
		of the angel, "Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of this book." </p>
		<p class="auto-style243"><span class="auto-style237">Kingdoms are ordered by the operation of law, 
		however much grace may abound; and Malkuth, 
	which anchors the inward Kingdom of Elohim, is ordered by the spiritual precepts of
		<a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/god">Elohim</a></span><a href="https://www.crowndiamond.org/cd/god"> <span class="auto-style93">myhla</span></a><span class="auto-style237">. Y'shúa might have taught, "Blessed are 
		they who shall hear the words of Life and do them: for they shall dwell 
		securely." It's&nbsp; wonderful, however, that the Silent Voice, giving 
		utterance through Y'shua, a Son of Man, withheld a 
		<img class="auto-style194" height="230" src="sep.ser.gif" style="margin: 17px 9px; float: right" width="210">blessing, 
		keeping it in reserve. Some shall imagine themselves worthy of the nine but shall be confounded by the tenth; so, also, 
		shall some see themselves as unworthy in the nine, but shall, by the tenth blessing, be confirmed in all to all, as it's written, "and the last, first."</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">There 
		is, perhaps, another reason there is not a tenth beatitude in the Srmon 
		on the Mount. Y'shua taught that the Kingdom-- Malkuth-- is like leaven hidden in measures of meal. Without digressing into what these measures of meal 
		might signify, we note that promised blessings explicitly mentioning the Kingdom 
		of Heaven occur twice in the beatitudes. 
		Why not three times, since the Kingdom of Names is hidden in three measures 
		of meal?</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">The answer is that the inward Kingdom is not 
		of this world, this cosmos, this age; and its leavening presence must remain hidden until 
		appearance of the full manifestation of the Sons of God. Remaining also hidden, then, is the fullness of God's blessings. The 
		full parameters of God's blessings and the sayings of Moshe, as well, 
		can be understood and 
		welcomed only with maturation of 
		Immanu<span class="auto-style93">AL</span>'s Kingdom-- with the 
		manifestation of God's Malkuth within each of us; 
	for it is said of those numbered among those who shall share that reality, that in their mouth is found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of
		<span class="auto-style93">la</span>.</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">The precepts of the Sermon on the Mount are the distilled essence of Y'shua's doctrinal 
		contribution to the Kingdom of Names. 
		They are the very fabric of the righteous mammon with which the Father clothed 
	him during his ministry. To hold them in one's heart-- not as the words of an individual, but as 
		the guiding 
		<span class="auto-style251"><a href="../Paleo/lamed.html">L</a></span> precepts
		<span class="auto-style93"><a href="../Paleo/alef.html">a</a></span> received
		<em>through</em> the individual who stood among his peers, giving true 
		and faithful testimony of the Inward Presence 
		creating the fruit of his 
		lips <em>as</em> he channeled the words in the moments he received them of Immanu<span class="auto-style93">AL</span>'s 
		inward, silent voice. To cherish those words while reading other scripture is to stand 
		openly before the open Door of that same Presence, from which 
		emanates every nuance of sound interpretation.<br class="auto-style261">

		<o:p>Those whose natural spirits are deflated, impoverished, are welcomed within the 
		Kingdom of Names. Their own estimations of who they are and what is 
		required of them leave them with no epectation of relief in spiritual or worldly 
		realms. Perishing from lack of vision and constantly sifting through nuggats of 
		their thoughts, they find 
		no wisdom: no traces of gold. The silver lining of understanding 
		eludes them, also; so they pan through the same cloudy streams of 
		thought over and over, 
		willing to settle for discovery of any shining thing. Hemmed in by piles 
		of mud, they lament 
		the inadequacy of their endeavors and lower expectations, resolving to endure as best they can 
		so long as they can. Spiritual paupers daring to hope for deliverance, they 
		await a flooding of the headwaters, as in the days of Noah.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p> </o:p>
		<o:p>Adam Kadmon, the "Projection of Man," is the symbol of the Tree of 
		Life. Kether is the topmost of its ten spheres, the sephiroth. Often 
		refered to as "The Supreme Crown," Kether is, in one aspect, the sphere of 
		intelligence. The human mind is the tool by which mankind has achieved dominion over 
		all other species on Earth, often to his own harm and shame; and man's 
		intelligence has been leveraged as the means to subject less endowed creatures 
				to the rule of his will, at the peril of all who live. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		When r<o:p>ightly applied, intelligence is the faculty by which man can measure the movements of 
				God's Spirit within his frame of consciousness, his field of being. 
		As a creature, the 
		Life Breath energizes every cell of the human body, supplying oxygen for the 
		divine fire within every heartbeat. Though it is intrinsic to his 
		metabolism, natural man isn't able to measure 
		the the Spirit's movements with the rational mind. Only the heart can 
		see; and that vision becomes operative, only when man's faculties are opened by an act of God.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		Natural man<o:p> is haunted when exposed to the hidden Presence, which 
		he sees as alien to his sense of who he is. When the Presence begins to 
		lift its head him, his heart and mind are consumed in a struggle to 
		comprehend what is going on. Like dust arising from a pivot point upon 
		dry ground, the dilemmas raised by the Indwelling cannot be resolved by 
		willful efforts of the heart 
		and mind, whose measurements must be braided together by 
		the Father's hands. W</o:p><o:p>hile the root (heart) and essence 
		(mind) of a man's intelligence 
		struggle together within the core of mortal man, their intelligence also operates on scales far beyond the confines of&nbsp; 
		what is revealed by life on Earth; and 
		the path to effective 
		measurement of this greater intelligence requires humility, the 
		impoverishment of the natural spirit of man as creature.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p>
		<img class="auto-style259" height="182" src="met3.cap.gif" style="float: left" width="130"></o:p><o:p>King Solomon 
				asked who could measure "the spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth." 
		Well, from both Hebrew and Greek scriptures, the words most commonly 
	translated as "spirit" are more properly rendered as "breath." </o:p>
		<o:p>The movements of 
		human spirit in the King James version of the 
				Ecclesiastes parable, then, are likened to the inhale (the 
		downward trajectory of untainted air) and the exhale (the upward 
		trajectory of spent breath). 
				Air is the substance of the second 
				heaven, and breathing it in lifts us up, renews us. However, the inhale 
		makes us debtors to the atmosphere, and we have no choice but to repay the skies 
		of heaven with our exhales, which carry the savor, the scent, of who we 
		are and what we've been up to. Breathing is a transaction between heaven 
		and earth.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		The e<o:p>xchange of the contrary winds of natural breath, correspond to 
		the interplay of the two laws that drive the whirlwind of which Paul 
				wrote in Romans 7. Like all beasts of Earth, we inhale the Breath of Life, 
		and we exhale the savor of the utilization of each breath we draw, whether unto 
		life or unto death. Caught up by the whirlwind, the tainted residue of 
		our essence travels with the 
		exhale, where it merges with fresh air and is cleansed of its toxicity, 
		made ready to be drawn again toward the ground as it surrenders 
		the weight of its savor within celestial realms, that it might return 
		to the gates of paradise and the throne of Father
		<span class="auto-style93">hy</span>.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p>The Breath of 
				<span class="auto-style229">hwhy</span> has been passed from 
		parent to child from the days of the first man, vivifying 
				humanity with the inward Presence of the Immortal One, who daily 
		humbles himself by dwelling within mortal tabernacles for the 
		perfection of mortal souls. 
				From the moment of&nbsp; father Adam's first Breath, the Projection of
				<span class="auto-style229">hy</span>-- 
		his Cry, his Shout of Life-- entered mankind; and stewardship of that 
		divine Breath transformed the man, a creature of clay, into a living soul, 
		a creature of light. As 
		host of the Breath, the man Adam served as prototype of the temple 
		formed not by handiwork, but by the Projected 
		Breath of God. A son carries the father's breath forward, which is the reason Torah calls 
		Adam the Son of God.</o:p></p>

			<o:p>The apostle John characterized the Breath of God as the Word,

		cannot contain its Creator, it is suffused with the Creator's projected <em>
		Pattern</em><span class="auto-style237">. The primal shout, "Let there 
			be," is his 
			"Son," and it fills all in all, which is why the Angel of his 
			Presence is called the Only-Begotten. Imprinted with the essence of 
			the divine pattern, all things live and move and have their being 
			because of the Father's proclamation that there should be Light.</span></o:p></div>

		<p class="auto-style243">
		Sacred geometry<o:p>, the royal pattern, was 
		released into the cosmos by 
				the Breath of God. That Pattern-- that Logos-- is called 
		<a href="../Matthew/Matthew2.html">Yahushua  
		<span class="auto-style239">
		owcw<span class="auto-style229">hy</span></span></a>, 
				the "Shout of Father <span class="auto-style229">hy</span><span class="auto-style237">," 
		his Battlecry. The Interface between the Creator and Creation, Yahushua is 
		the Angel of God's Presence; for he was 
		with and of God from the beginning. Yahushua rides upon the 
				command, "Let there be"; for without that Presence, there is no thing. 
		By 
		the agency of this Interface, the Father enlivened the first man 
				with his Breath, his Spirit, his Essence, his <em>Pattern. </em>
		This is why Adam 
		is the called the 
				first and the last: the first, who is also found standing </span> <em>
		with</em> the last. 
		Adam is 
				the "Son of God," the cornerstone of the temple made 
		without hands; for in Man are joined the collective of the spiritual Names 
		understood as 
		the Sons of Man, the Children of God.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p>If a man does not recognize the 
				pattern's presence, still it is there. Immanu<span class="auto-style93">AL</span>'s hidden Presence 
		proclaims the Father's will from within the 
		thick darkness of unbelieving hearts, projecting the Pattern until such 
		time the Father has chosen to reveal 
		himself through the operations of&nbsp; the Interface. Whether unknown 
		by doubters or known by believers, the Interface is also called Immanu<span class="auto-style93">AL</span>, God within us. 
		Doing the Father's bidding because he is of the Father, the Interface is busy perfecting the 
				temple of humanity in accordance with the Pattern of which he is 
		the fullest expression, to the end that all 
		living souls shall be raised up and presented before the Father's throne without spot or blemish 
		at the last day, 
		made ready to inhabit immortal tabernacles capable of exploring the nuances of the Father's 
		Essence in all that is and shall forever be. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p> </o:p>
		<o:p>
		<o:p>To be clear: t</o:p>he 
				blessed fullness of Immanu<span class="auto-style93">AL</span>'s 
		Presence was first seen in the life of true and faithful 
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shua</a>, whose ministry bore witness to the will and the power of 
				Father <span class="auto-style229">hy</span>. 
		As they served, Moses and the prophets didn't know that their faces glowed; but Y'shua knew 
		the significance of his position. Standing in their company in the 
		presence of witnesses, he was transfigured as recognition of his full measurement of the operations of Yahushua 
		within his bodily walk on Earth. By 
				following in his footsteps as grace shall allow, therefore, each of us 
				shares the promise of standing before the throne of Yah in white 
		raiment alongside Y'shua 
		and the storied saints of scripture. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p>Resting in the Father's Breath, therefore, we 
		are to exercise faith in his Wisdom by 
		accepting Messiah's cross as our own. We are to mpoverish ourselves. We 
		must be willing to suffer the penalties of 
		error in our ministries; for by his stripes we are healed. In dying,
		<a href="falling.html">Y'shua teaches</a>, we will not surely die; for some will pass from life unto Life 
		without tasting death. Of the rest it is written, "If you do 
		well, shall you not be accepted?" Through his position as host of
		<span class="auto-style93">
				owcwhy</span>-- as body of the Projected Breath of Elohim, the 
		Interface between Heaven and Earth-- Y'shua understood that every spent breath 
		of every creature on Earth returns to the Father's 
		care, 
		whatever its savor. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		T<o:p>he man Y'shua and his church have been tarnished by error due to the 
		<a href="iniquity.html">operations of&nbsp; 
		inertia</a> inherent in human affairs, as in the physical uniuverse. The 
		fall following Golgotha came quickly upon the Essene believers, prompting 
		the lament, "The mystery of iniquity doth already work." Confessing 
		their errors, their sins, these same men understood that none but one 
		shall be tarnished with accusation at the end of days. If any is ashamed of errors, 
		that shame accuses brethren who share the same errors.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style243">
		<o:p>Impoverish the spirit 
		of manifest destiny at the expense of less fortunate men. Such thinking isolates you, one from another. Be willing to 
		humble yourself, as did Y'shua at the tables of publicans and sinners. 
		Dare to step again into the ditches with which you are familiar, just far enough to give a fallen 
		brother the 
		boost he needs to heal and regain his way. Although an 
		unknowable future lays before us all, we know that no accusation will 
		stand in the fullness of time. If the Son, the Indwelling, shall make 
		you free, you are free, indeed. Though our errors be as scarlet, they 
		shall be white as snow. Although we became unclean through ignorant 
		carelessness, innocence perserveres in us. Practices brought guilt upon us; but because 
		of the active agency of 
		Yahushua, the Interface, Father <span class="auto-style93">hy</span> winks at our 
		errors as we recognize and welcome the inward Presence. HaShem stretches 
		out his arms to us as both Redeemer and Deliverer: as 
		both Author and Finisher of the faith he began in us.</o:p></p>
