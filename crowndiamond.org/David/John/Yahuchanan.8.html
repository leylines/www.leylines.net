		</span><![endif]>To that end, early the next morning, he again came into

		interrupted his teachings by parading before those listening to him a 
		woman guilty of adultery, who they had taken into custody. They rudely 
		dragged her into the room, creating a disruptive spectacle. Then, 
		pulling against her arms, this way and that, they bullied her into the 
		center of the crowd and proceeded to accuse not her, as she was clearly 
		guilty. No! They brought accusation against Y’shua

		a clearcut reason to bring charges against him about a settled issue 
		that wouldn’t depend on some clever interpretation of “spiritual

		finger, he scribbled on the ground, as though he wasn’t listening to 
		them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><br>7 </b>And presently, after 
		they had continued pressing him, Y’shua raised himself up; and when he

		the accusers; for absorbing the import of his reply, those men became 
		convicted in their own minds by their own thoughts concerning such 
		matters. One by one, beginning with the most respected among them, and 
		ending with their most junior followers, they made their quiet escapes. 
		Presently, Y’shua and the woman were left standing alone, both of them

		bring accusation against him. Y’shua and the woman faced the crowd, 
		together; so Y’shua asked her, “Woman, where are those who brought 
		accusation against you? Does no man condemn you?”
		<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><br>11 </b>She said, “No man,
