		stones with your thoughts. Are they caught in the act, in your opinion? 
		Should the apostles be judged for admitting they were beset by errors? 
		Is any of you better, in comparison? Is it not written that to offend in 
		one point is to offend in all?! Judgmental busybodies! They are sons of 
		god, as we are instructed: When you've done--or thought, for that 
		matter-- a thing concerning the least, you've done it unto the Son of 
		God. This teaching entails more than messiah sticking up for the 
		unfortunate; it's warning that all people carry messiah within 
		themselves, even while bound by error. If we had known our thoughts and 
		deeds concerning "the lost" effectively murdered, in our minds, the 
		reality of messiah within them, we would not have so killed the Lord of 
		Glory. Don't reach out to anysuch as though they're to be pitied, no 
		matter how pitiful they are by conventional understanding; reach out to 
		touch the Son of God in these, your brothers and sisters, calling 
		messiah forth! The saved and the lost?! Bah!!!! NONE shall be lost but 
		the Son of Perdition, the memory of the error in each of us, upon that 
		day we shall come together in the unity of Faith, crying Abba, Father, 
		Blessed be your name!</td>
