		<td class="auto-style76">The name Lucifer means "Light Bearer." The 
		covering cherub of heaven, he was perfect in all his ways until iniquity 
		was found in him. It is commonly understood that "iniquity" is "grossly 
		unfair or immoral behavior." If that's the case, his perfection was 
		conditional on his performance: his to achieve and maintain, and his to 
		lose; and the inquity found in him was generated by a narcissistic 
		pride: "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a 
		fall."<br><br>My view is that the imperfection discovered in Lucifer was 
		due to a bending of the light he carried, not because of some fault of 
		character. His fall came after the creation of Earth; for his judgment 
		was to be cast down to Earth to live and die as Man, subsequent to the 
		discovery iniquity, which must have "crept into him, unawares," to 
		borrow the scriptural phrase.<br><br>The light he carried within himself 
		was bent by the pull of inertia. The force of gravity accompanies all 
		mass in Creation. Iniquity is the spiritual equivalent of the latent 
		force of inertia: gravity, which has the power to bend light. His fall 
		wasn't due to sin or error, precisely; but to the effects of the 
		essential cohesive element of the universe. There would be no accretion 
		of mass without inertia: no Earth, no life. <br><br>The pull of Creation 
		bent the light Lucifer carried within himself. Because of this effect of 
		iniquity, he was cast from the immortal realm to the mortal realm; and 
		the loss of the heavenly state was a severe change, but it was not 
		tragic. It is written that all things in the strange work of Father YH 
		work together for good.The angels shouted for joy at the creation of 
		man; for mankind would be the vehicle for the tranformation of angels 
		from *bearers* of light by their recreation as *beings* of Light. This 
		mystery is
		<img class="auto-style77" height="354" src="phoenix.gif" style="float: left" width="187">among 
		the things the early believers were unable to bear: not because of some 
		failing or weakness, but because of the sequential aspect of knowledge. 
		One must understand "this" in order to be able to understand "that."<br>
		<br>Thus, the apostle laments, "the mystery of iniquity does already 
		work." Stumbles among believers were apparent. The path of the cross 
		must lead to knowledge of the intersection of the mortal and immortal 
		realms. Those born of the flesh who truly walk in the steps of Y'shua 
		are born of the Holy Breath, the Holy Spirit. Far greater than the light 
		found in natural man, the light in within spiritual man is the very 
		essence of the Godhead. Even so, they must carry this treasure in 
		earthen vessels.<br><br>Living the life of the Spirit in mortal bodies 
		is a dynamic experience, and the body mass opf physical man exerts an 
		equivalent of the latent force of inertia upon the new creature, the 
		spiritual man. This is why Paul saw two laws operating within himself, 
		and why the scripture speaks of twins struggling within the womb.It is 
		written, "the end shall not come, except there be a falling away, 
		first." <br><br>The phoenix once flew near the Source of Light, but 
		burned to the ground at his first approach. Having fallen back to Earth, 
		it was incumbent for it to rise again. A roughly equivalent experience 
		unfolds as natural man, reborn of the Holy Breath as spiritual man, 
		joins in the procession to the great wedding feast of the Messiah of 
		Matthew 1:1 in the steps of the man of Matthew 1:16. In this awakend 
		state, believers are able to add knowledge to experience as they, again, 
		appoach the gates of Heaven.<br><br>It is inevitable that the new 
		creature rising from the waters of baptism should stumble. Offense will 
		come, and woe to them who are the cause of it; but mercy and restoration 
		to those who must experience it.<br><br>If we say we are without sin we 
		deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us; but if we confess our 
		errors-- our sins, the Holy Father is faithful to forgive us and to 
		cleanse us from all unrighteousness.The filthy rags of unrighteoussness 
		will be cleansed not in the pew, but by being put to use in the world's 
		ditches, as those walking in Messiah lend helping hands to fallen 
		brothers. If believers cordon themselves off from others they perceive 
		to be unrighteous in order to protect their sense of their own 
		righteousness, they will discover their lamps lack oil as the great 
		wedding feast comes nearer with every darkening day of Earth.<br><br>By 
		this you shall know that you are disciples of Master Y'shua: that you 
		have love for one another: and not only for others you see as good, but 
		for all who live. <br><br>Judge not. <br><br>Accuse not. <br><br>Open to 
		love.</td>
