		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		We’re made in God’s image, in God’s likeness; but the scripture is 
		clear: God is not a man, but an invisible Spirit, unfathomable. Were it 
		not for our spirit, we could know nothing of God’s presence. With our 
		natural intelligence, we might suspect or reason that God exists, but we 
		could never know God, because intelligence, though God’s gift for each 
		of us, is limited. Some are quite gifted; some, not. If we could measure 
		the godhead with our minds, then God is a respecter of persons, giving 
		advantage or disadvantage according to an individual’s intelligence 
		quotient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		No. God is a Spirit, a Holy Breath; and each of us is gifted with a 
		spirit, and our human spirits can dance with the Holy Spirit of God 
		because there’s an Interface, a Door, a Nexus: an invisible, 
		unfathomable point of contact. This place of meeting, where spirit can 
		meld, wed with Spirit by means of the Door, the Projected Spirit of 
		HaShem. Allow me to refer to God as HaShem, if you will; for the word <i>
		God</i> has various meanings for each of us, and none of us can properly 
		defend what we believe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		HaShem. It means, “The Name:” Yod/He/Waw/He. The Name was given to Moshe 
		(Moses) on Mount Sainai. Moses didn’t see HaShem; for none of us can see 
		infinity. Our minds take us so far and leave us stranded in wonder or in 
		consternation; but our spirits can come to rest within the Holy Spirit 
		of HaShem; for if we seek God with our spirits, they are able to 
		discover the Interface, to “touch” it with the faculty of feeling, which 
		resides in our hearts, not in our minds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		The Name is given for a reason. Moses read and wrote in the Hebrew in 
		use at the time of Exodus from Egypt. Sinaitic Hebrew was not a 
		mysterious language. It was the common language of the Mediterranean 
		basin and was used in commerce: in trade, so that peoples from different 
		nations could understand one another. In this present time, English 
		serves that role. In times past, that role was served by Latin, Spanish, 
		French, Arabic: by whatever power dominated the world, or a significant 
		portion of the world, at different eras of history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Today’s Hebrew is quite different. Aramaic Hebrew was born during the 
		time when the nation state of Israel, which was born with the coronation 
		of King Saul, fell into captivity by the world power called Babylon. No 
		longer masters of their days, the people of Israel found need for 
		secrecy, so that they could preserve their heritage without the 
		interference of the secular world power to which they had succumbed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Aramaic Hebrew has two faces. Biblical Hebrew was preserved as the means 
		of maintaining access to the teachings that began with the ancient 
		fathers and peaked in the days of Moshe, who wrote in the pattern used 
		on Mt. Sinai, which was a precise version of that time’s common 
		language. You will recall that a mixed multitude accompanied Moshe into 
		the desert at the Exodus from Mitzraim. They had the need to 
		communicate, and that need was met by use of that time’s common 
		language, which had many names: Hebrew, Proto-Canaanite, Ancient Greek, 
		Ancient Arabic, Phoenician. It was the day’s common language, and each 
		nation state claimed it as its own. What distinguished Sinaitic Hebrew 
		was the precise design of the alphabet of the common language. That 
		design consists of fractals of the mathematics of Creation. <o:p></o:p>
		</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		The hairs of our heads numbered, as is everything in creation. 
		Scientists can express nearly all things by numbers. Not God. Apart from 
		calculation, the concept of zero is as close as science can come to 
		defining God’s presence. They have a special name for that concept. They 
		call it “elsewhere.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		As incarnate beings, we are digital expressions; and every glance of our 
		eyes is focused not on ourselves, but “elsewhere.” Up, down, out, or 
		around, we scan elsewhere, absorbing what information comes to mind. Our 
		minds wrestle with the mathematics underlying Creation, and our 
		hearts—our spirits—absorb what the mind perceives and formulate new 
		avenues of inquiry based on the data measured by the mind at any given 
		moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Our spirits--the life sustained by the beats of our hearts—can focus on 
		the things of this world, and they can reach out to things unseen, 
		seeking “handholds,” so that the mind can be fed; and if our hearts are 
		enlarged, so are our minds. If we seek answers to questions that touch 
		upon infinite conundrums, our hearts must be enlarged. If we focus on 
		the finite matters of those things our intelligence perceives, then our 
		minds reach limitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		There is a place in us where hearts and minds can be one. We know peace 
		when that place is paramount. It has a seldom-used place in scripture; 
		and that place is sometimes called “Immanuel,” meaning “God with us, 
		within us.” When we touch upon that place (our hearts and minds together 
		as one), we touch upon the Door, the Interface, the Nexus between our 
		spirits and the Holy Spirit of HaShem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Later called “Christians,” the Essenes preached and wrote about that 
		place of congruence between the spirits of mankind and the Holy Spirit 
		of HaShem. They were soon persecuted by the scars of the world, but 
		their writings were preserved by pen and by word of mouth; also, by the 
		treasures preserved within jars in the caves of Qumran. Those writings 
		are snapshots of Essene understandings and will do much to restore not 
		only their doctrines, but also the true teachings of Sainai.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		A key teaching is that the godhead is vastly superior to those things 
		that can be measured. The name <i>Moshe</i> is the word <i>HaShem</i> 
		written backwards: Creation is as a reflection of HaShem, which is why 
		the Essenes wrote: “Search the scriptures; for in them you think you 
		have eternal life, whereas these are they that testify of me”: if we 
		hunger for knowledge of HaShem’s presence, we must look where God can be 
		found. That place is seated in our hearts, not in our minds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		As they seek the faces of HaShem, our hearts are enlarged: they are born 
		again; and the spiritual things revealed to our hearts enlarge our 
		minds, also. As we question the reality of HaShem, our spirits knock 
		upon the Door called Immanuel, “God within us.” Answers come not as the 
		result of our thoughts, but through the Nexus between the Holy Spirit of 
		HaShem and the individual realities experienced by the spirits of 
		individuals. That Nexus is the Projection, the “Son,” of HaShem. Already 
		hidden within all things of Creation, Immanuel can be known and 
		understood by our spirits as they feed upon the projected Spirit of 
		HaShem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Not some strange, esoteric phenomenon, God’s Spirit is with us always. 
		Our spirits can reach out to HaShem in the same manner they reach out to 
		any created thing, lifting perceptions to the mind, where they can be 
		recorded and collated; but understanding doesn’t fall under the 
		intellectual purview. Hearts that are driven by intellect become bound 
		by intellect; and this is the state scripture calls “thick darkness.” If 
		encased by the mind, the heart becomes desperately wicked; for it has 
		accepted limited intellect as its god, and its questioning rebounds upon 
		itself, like a kernel encased in its shell. The heart must be born 
		again: the shell must be penetrated and left behind, so that Life can 
		sprout anew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		I’ve written all this, not knowing why. The words proceed from my heart, 
		as though knocking on a door. That door is the limitations of my heart 
		and mind: it’s the shell of my understanding. I can offer no 
		indisputable argument; for I find, in myself, no answer to my own 
		questions but this: peace comes when my human spirit, knocking upon the 
		Door to Immanuel that was hidden within my heart from my first moment of 
		life on Earth, is allowed to open, so that my understanding can feed 
		upon the Spirit of HaShem by means of the Interface that tirelessly 
		beats within the thick darkness of my heart, that it may sprout forth, 
		revealing itself not only to me, but to all with whom I interact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		What then is HaShem, the Holy Name? It’s a succinct statement of 
		covenant between God and Creation. Every action of God (the Yod) results 
		in revelation (the fist He); and as each revelation is received and 
		cherished (the Waw), we then are blessed with enlightenment (the second 
		He). For any who has yet to confess the inadequacy of human limitations, 
		The Name promises that each action (Yod/He) will have its effect 
		(Waw/He) in experience; and, bumbling around between one such effect and 
		another, each will eventually come to the point that the human spirit 
		will reach inward and discover what has been hidden in every heart from 
		natural birth: Life itself, the Projection of HaShem, the unspeakable 
		gift of Life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Seek HaShem where God can be found. Yes, all things <i>reflect</i> the 
		same spiritual reality; but God is known by HaShem’s <i>Projection</i> 
		as it becomes seated in the thrones of our hearts. When we accept that 
		projection as Savior, the remnants of the Tabernacle of David are 
		restored ad rebuilt within our hearts. The name David signifies heart 
		(Dalet) wed (Waw) with the Divine Heart (Dalet):
		<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>the door of the individual heart 
		opening unto the Door of the Heavenly Father, the Divine Projection of 
		the Holy Spirit of HaShem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Harden not your hearts. The arc of time traced by the history of man is 
		shortened, that Earth might be preserved for the Elect; for natural man 
		has made a mess of Creation, and it’s the Father’s will that Earth 
		should be inhabited by those walking in the footsteps of the Essene 
		Teacher of Righteousness who walked in the name of Y’shua because his 
		heart was filled by Yahushua, the Projection of HaShem. The Essene 
		teaching wasn’t new. It was restoration of the true teachings of Moshe, 
		absent the inventions and traditions of mankind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Is it not so? Hosea ben Nun (nobody and everybody’s son) was called to 
		serve in the tent of Moshe in the wilderness. He was given a new name: 
		Joshua, Y’shua. As he served with Moshe, his heart was enlarged, and his 
		name changed again: it wasn’t spelled differently, as at first, but it 
		was understood differently. Thus, Joshua/Y’shua became as one with 
		HaShem; and the name was pronounced as Jehoshua/Yahushua, which is the 
		only name under heaven by which we must be saved, that we may be 
		resurrected among the living; for it’s the Name of the Logos, the Word, 
		the Essence of HaShem’s ineffable Spirit, Ruach HaQodesh as projected 
		within Creation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%">
		Moshe had vision of the state of being granted to Y’shua in Yahushua, in 
		the Projection of HaShem. His writings reflect so many of God’s secrets, 
		but it’s the spirit that drove him to write that takes us into the Lands 
		of Promise: into the states of being that unfold only by the Spirit of 
		which he wrote. It’s the knowledge of the presence of Yahushua within 
		our hearts that allows us to leave Pisgah behind, that our souls may be 
		cleansed through immersion in the waters of Yardan, to be reborn among 
		as holy warriors of clad with the complete armor of God, enabling us to 
		successfully wage Jihad, the holy war between the chosen and the 
		condemned: between the twins struggling within the wombs of our hearts, 
		that our minds can attain the stature of HaMashiyach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
