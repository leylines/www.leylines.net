      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">The two squares rotated against each
      other in the center octagram recall the four-square measurement
      of the altar built for the tent of meeting. The diagram approximates
      the three- and five-cubit measurements of that altar by means
      of a certain logic, but those measurements cannot be unequivalently
      duplicated with precision in this system of drawings by use of
      the mathematical tools I understand. There is a time and purpose
      for all things under the sun, however; and, together, we shall
      come to a full understanding of these matters as such knowledge
      becomes useful.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Knowledge as stored information is valuable
      and unavoidable, but it can become an obstacle to further revelation.
      To focus upon knowledge as a goal, however, violates the initiative
      of divine revelation, making of it a thing coveted-a thing, ultimately,
      to be hoarded in jealousy and guarded with contention. True Wisdom
      is the unique property of HaShem, making foolishness of the wisdom
      derived from mortal pursuits. True Understanding is the unique
      gift of HaShem to those readied to receive its honor. Knowledge
      as an absolute exists only at HaShem's level. At all other levels,
      knowledge is the product of a manipulation of the wisdom and
      understanding with which a supplicant has been blessed in a moment
      in time, or over a period of time.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We do not serve forms. Knowledge on
      the planes of transformation is a rudimentary formulation of
      data and speculation: a formulation that is derived from our
      capacities to receive of Wisdom and Understanding and that is
      instigated by our desires for their utilization in our lives.
      Knowledge derived from insights is but a shadowy knowledge: a
      golden calf that must be returned to the holy fire of Wisdom,
      again and again, for reduction and ultimate revision.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">We are to entertain the alloys of human
      knowledge with detachment, chewing the cud while keeping our
      eyes upon the True Goal, the faces of HaShem. True Knowledge
      will come as a latter rain: it's inevitable. We must be prepared
      to welcome it, but we are not permitted to hunt it down and to
      dig it up by the roots to possess it. To attempt to do so is
      idolatry. When the Door to Knowledge opens to us, we should enter
      and partake of what is revealed for as long as it is tendered;
      otherwise, we must maintain our souls in patience, asking of
      HaShem the righteous, whole-cloth gifts of Wisdom and Understanding,
      according to His will.</FONT>
