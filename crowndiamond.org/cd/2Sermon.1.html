		<p class="auto-style186">
		Almost hypnotic in their cadence, the beatitudes of the Matthew gospel promise the approval and bounty of God's 
		Spirit to 
		those whose souls reflect the principles they espouse. Not random thoughts, they 
		speak to the seats and operations of the Father's Holy Spirit in each of us, stirring our 
		attention and arousing our hope. The teachings establish 
		guardrails for the path that will lead to fulfillment of the Ten Sayings that 
		came by Moshe. They were given to strengthen our ears, that we might hear, and 
		to clarify our vision, that we might see. In their light, the commandments 
		of Moses can be understood as prophecies that speak of God's love for 
		us and of his pledge for our redemption.<p class="auto-style186">
		The two-edged sword given utterance by the tongue of Moses held 
		overtones of betrothal more powerful than the noted threat against 
		disobedience, and the words delivered on the lowly hill of Galilee 
		drove home the point at the darkness of our hearts. The Sermon on the 
		Mount is a song woven into nine verses that remind us that we are to 
		learn what it means, that HaShem will have mercy, not sacrifice.<p class="auto-style186">
		<span class="auto-style121">When 
		the <a href="howl.html">nations</a> are driven out of the soul, the
		<a href="city.3.gif">Kingdom of Names</a> appears from within; and those 
		gathering at Mount Tsion awaken in the manner of dreamers being aroused 
		from deep sleep; for, like the hidden presence of Immanu</span><span class="auto-style204">AL</span><span class="auto-style121">, the Kingdom of Heaven 
		has been with us, always: 
		through the depths and the heights of every moment of every life on 
		Earth. God's song of point and counter point calls us to awaken to the 
		blessings that will come as HaShem </span>
		<span class="auto-style93"><span class="auto-style180">hwhy</span><span class="auto-style121"> </span>
		</span>
		<span class="auto-style121">brings us into alignment with the will and principles of 
		Father </span>
		<span class="auto-style204">hy</span><span class="auto-style121">. </span>
		<p class="auto-style186">
		<span class="auto-style121">My study of the beatitudes began with a focus on Malkuth,
		then fixed itself upon Kether, 
		so that I could turn again to Malkuth with better understanding of what 
		the way of the cross requires of me. Acknowledging my 
		limitations, I counted myself ready to draw upon the righteousness of
		</span>
		<span class="auto-style204">hwhy</span><span class="auto-style121"> by searching out the Father's will in 
		all things at all times. This approach is not so disorderly as it seems. 
		Its basis in the traditions of kabbalah is 
		a focus of the 
	Malkuth text of the message addressed to the angel at  
		<a href="ephesus.html">Ephesus</a>.</span><span class="auto-style186"> 
		Along the way, we are to mount the seven rungs of Jacob's Ladder within the light of the 
		seven candlesticks of the </span><span class="auto-style121">Churches of 
		Asia. Like moths being drawn to the flame, we are uplifted by the hands of
		<a href="God.html">God</a> in the comforting
		<a href="../Matthew/matthew1.html">Light of Heaven</a>.</span><p class="auto-style86">
		<span class="auto-style121">What, then, do we make of the night? As 
		successive evenings come upon us, we trust that mornings will follow; and, 
		so, we take 
		our rest, expecting a new day as we face the whirling swords in the 
		inward struggles of jihad, that 
		holy war being waged by the twins in the womb. Brothers are for 
		adversity; and as spiritual
		<img class="auto-style193" height="114" src="menorah.8.gif" style="float: left" width="158">darkness presses upon us, we look forward to the reconciliation and relief that will come with enlightenment. 
		By our struggles, we learn that we can arouse ourselves, but that the 
		oil in our lamps must be replenished. We can engage inadequacy by turning on this or that light, dimming the 
		gloom in the room; but the reliable fullness of true light will come only 
		with the break of day.</span><p class="auto-style86">I<span class="auto-style121"> 
		have undertaken this study to examine what the spheres of kabbalah add to appreciation of 
		the beatitudes. Whatever the sephiroth can contribute to an understanding of 
		such matters must not be gainsaid; for revelation, we recall, is given by the "littles."
		</span>
		<span class="auto-style186">
		I don't mean to suggest, therefore, that what follows is 
		some grandiose interpretation of these words of
		<a href="../Matthew/50Jesus.html">Y'shua</a>. To be scrupulously honest, 
		I'm drawing upon the hope that someone's reading these words to help me 
		reason out my thoughts, under the cover of masking these words as examples of kabbalistic exegesis. </span></p>
		<p class="auto-style86"><span class="auto-style186">
		To those who 
		think kabbalists make too much of numbers in scripture, whether explicitly stated or merely implied, I offer reminder that even the hairs of our heads are numbered, 
	a point to which the Essene Teacher of Righteousness gave cryptic emphasis. It's not presumptuous, 
		therefore, to 
		argue that the operation of numbers in scripture has intended significance. Overlooking 
		such literal enforcement of the plausibility of 
		this approach, I will proceed, hoping for company along the way.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style86"><span class="auto-style121">The attitudes of 
		being addressed by 
		Saint Matthew are nine in number. As the sephiroth are ten, the 
		relevance of the nine blessings isn't immediately apparent. However, a tenth beatitude 
	is hidden in the precepts beginning with Matthew 5:13 and continuing, minimally, through the end of Matthew 7, in the teaching of the wise man who both hears and performs the sayings 
		that came by Y'shua. 
		The unstated, tenth beatitude is also affirmed in Revelation 22 with the words 
		of the angel, "Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of this book."
		</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style86"><span class="auto-style121">Kingdoms are ordered by the operation of law; and Malkuth, 
	which represents the inward Kingdom of Elohim, is ordered by the spiritual precepts of
		<a href="God.html">Elohim</a></span><a href="God.html">
						<span class="auto-style184">myhla</span></a><span class="auto-style121">, however much grace may abound. Y'shúa might have taught, "Blessed are they who shall hear the words of 
	Life and do them: for they shall dwell securely." It's rather wonderful, however, that 
	the Small Voice, speaking through a Son of Man, withheld a hidden blessing, in reserve. 
		Some shall imagine themselves worthy of the nine, but shall be confounded by the tenth; so, also, 
		shall some see themselves as unworthy in the nine, but shall, by the tenth blessing, be confirmed in all to all, as it's written, "and the last, first."</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style86"><span class="auto-style121">
		<img class="auto-style194" height="230" src="sep.ser.gif" style="float: right" width="210">There 
		is, perhaps, another reason no written beatitude can be directly 
		attributed to operations of Malkuth. Y'shua taught that the Kingdom-- Malkuth-- is like leaven hidden in measures of meal. Without digressing into what the measures of meal 
		signify, we note that the beatitude that might be tied explicitly to the Kingdom is promised twice in the beatitudes. 
		Why not three times? The answer may be that the Kingdom of Names is not 
		of this world, this cosmos, this age, and must remain hidden until the full manifestation of the Sons of God. 
		Also hidden, then, is the fullness of God's blessing. The ultimate blessing will be 
		welcomed in the morning mankind satisfies the precepts of the beatitudes and of 
		the sayings of Moshe, as well. God's fullest blessing will be conferred upon 
		all who experience the inward maturation of 
		God's Kingdom-- of God's Malkuth; 
	for it is said of those gathered there that in their mouth is found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of
		</span> 
						<span class="auto-style204">la</span><span class="auto-style121">.</span></p>
		<p class="auto-style86"><span class="auto-style121">The precepts of the Sermon on the Mount are the distilled essence of Y'shua's doctrinal 
		contribution to the Kingdom. 
		They are the very fabric of the righteous mammon with which the Father clothed 
	him. To hold them in one's heart-- not as the words of an individual, but as guiding 
		precepts received </span> <em><span class="auto-style121">through</span></em><span class="auto-style121"> 
		a spokesman who stood among his peers, 
		testifying as true and faithful witness of the Inward Presence creating the fruit of his 
		lips. To cherish these words while reading other scriptures is to stand 
		openly before the open Door of that same Presence, through which 
		emanates every nuance of sound interpretation.</span></p>

		<o:p>Within the Projection of Adam, Kether is the sphere of 
		intelligence: it is the crown by which Man has achieved dominion over 
		all other species on Earth. Lately, to his own harm and shame, Man's 
		intelligence has been used to subject lesser creatures 
				to his will. Rightly applied, however, intelligence is the faculty by which 
		a man is able to measure the movements of 
				God's Spirit within his own being. That mankind can measure 
		inward movements of transcendent Spirit is affirmation of the existence of an alien Intelligence 
		within human consciousness that 
		hides at the center of his being, operating on a 
				scale far beyond the confines of "rational" thought. Effective 
		measurement of that higher intelligence requires humility, which is the 
		impoverishment of natural, creature spirit.</o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<o:p><span class="auto-style121">King Solomon 
				asked, who can measure "the spirit of Man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth." 
		Well, in both Hebrew and Greek scriptures, the words most commonly 
	translated as "spirit" could be rendered in translation as "breath." The movements of 
		human spirit in the King James version of the 
				Ecclesiastes parable are likened to the inhale and the exhale of breath. 
				That we inhale air, the substance of the firmament (the second 
				heaven), makes us debtors; and with the exhale, we continually 
				repay, so that we can borrow Breath again. These air currents are the contrary winds that drive the whirlwind of which Paul 
				wrote in Romans 7. As all beasts, we inhale the Breath of Life, 
		and we exhale the savor of our utilization of that Breath, whether unto 
		life or unto death. The gasses in our exhale merge again with the air of 
		the second heaven and are drawn again to the ground, after surrendering 
		the weight of our savor to the astral, where it undertakes its journey 
		to the gates of paradise.</span></o:p></p>

				<span class="auto-style205">hwhy</span><span class="auto-style121"> has been passed from 
				parent to child since the days of the first man, vivifying 
				humanity with the inward Presence of the Immortal One, who 
		humbles himself to take up residence within mortal tabernacles for the 
		perfection of mortal souls. 
				From the moment of father Adam's first Breath, the Projection of
		</span>
				<span class="auto-style205">hy</span><span class="auto-style121">-- 
		his cry, his shout of Life-- entered directly into 
		the man's 
				body. Adam's reception and stewardship of that divine Breath transformed the creature of clay into a living soul. As 
				host of the Breath, the man Adam became the Son, the temple of God.</span></o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<o:p><span class="auto-style121">The apostle John characterized the Breath of God as the Logos, 
				the Word, the </span> <em><span class="auto-style121">pattern</span></em><span class="auto-style121"> of Creation; for without that Pattern and 
				its operations, nothing was made that is made. No man, including

				the prophet Ezekiel that the Breath invested in Man-- the Essence 
		that made the man a living creature-- is full of eyes, round and about. 
		These eyes that roam within Man as a living creature are the 
				source of mankind's intelligence, giving him leverage over all other 
				life on Earth. The crown of Kether isn't given to Man as tool 
				for the subjugation or exploitation of Life. It is given that we

		The r<o:p><span class="auto-style121">oot of man's intelligence, it is the Breath of God that furnishes

		<o:p>Breathing quietly in the context of the serpent's words-- now in, and now out-- Adam was able to measure 
				the Indwelling Spirit of the Father. He 
		was able to temporize 
	his response to the moment of temptation with tutored knowledge of the Father's Presence; for the Breath of the Father 
		had been 
		his soul's constant companion from its beginning, and the Father's 
		counsel had robbed 
	the threat of death of its sting when the commandment not to eat first came. 
		In due course, Eve 
		became 
				God's good gift. Had Adam intervened as his wife reached out 
		to the lesser tree, it would have brought tacit 
				accusation against the Father's Wisdom. Worse, it would have 
		raised questions against the Father's 
				good will. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<o:p><span class="auto-style121">Resting in the Breath, therefore, Adam 
				exercised faith in the Father's Wisdom by choosing to suffer with Eve the penalty of 
		her error; for he did not doubt the <a href="../Nod/Garden/serpent.html">serpent's</a> words that, in dying, they would not surely die. 
				Through his position as host of </span> 
		<span class="auto-style204">
				owcwhy</span><span class="auto-style121">-- of the Projected Breath of Elohim, the Interface between Heaven and Earth-- he 
				simply </span> <em><span class="auto-style121">had</span></em><span class="auto-style121"> to have understood that every spent breath returns to the Father, 
		whatever its savor. Though the couple had been tarnished by error due to 
		the inertia of inherent limitations, though they were ashamed, though an 
		unknowable future lay before them, no accusation against them would 
		stand in the fullness of time. Although they had become unclean, they 
		were innocent.</span></o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<span class="auto-style121">Adam
		</span>
		<o:p><span class="auto-style121">understood that the Father replenishes 
		the Breath of Life within the creature's lungs, 
		in accordance with his good pleasure; and the warning against eating, 
		itself, had 
		reminded him that it was the 
				Father's pleasure that life should continue. The husbandman 
				charged with cultivating the Garden, he also knew that 
				unless a seed falls to the ground, it abides alone. He had to have 
				believed that the death about which the Father warned would surely 
				come; therefore, the course he followed is evidence that he understood 
		that death would 
				not bring a finishing end: that it would bring an extension, a time 
		for the planting of holy 
				seed. In dying, they would not die.</span></o:p></p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<o:p><span class="auto-style121">The couple had become 
		</span> 
		<a href="falling.html"><span class="auto-style121">draped with shame</span></a><span class="auto-style121"> because of error; but Adam 
				had to have known from his evening walks in the Garden that if 
				the Father were to allow evil to come upon them, it would be 
				through his Wisdom, not because of his carelessness. Husband and wife 
		had covered themselves in rags, understanding their nakedness, but the marriage compact between 
		them had been sworn with an oath. For Adam to have abandoned Eve to her fate would 
		have dishonored both <a href="../Nod/Garden/Eve.html">Eve</a> and
		<a href="../Nod/Garden/adam.html">Adam</a>, himself. His wife was bone of his bone and flesh of his 
	flesh. Adam could not rightly have forsaken her. By sharing 
				with her the forbidden tree's fruit, he made sure that she would meet 
				her fate with him by her side. </span> </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<o:p> </o:p>
		<o:p>They would not surely 
				die. With children and children's children sure to follow after them, 
		the man and his wife would continue together as one flesh, serving the Father 
				to the degree they were able, until that great final day when the 
		vast families of Adam 
		should overcome as One and death should be no more. 
				At the end of days, humanity would reach perfection, together. Until that time, the Breath of Life would 
		be passed from fathers and mothers through sons and 
				daughters until all could be reunited in the perfection of One 
		House, the Body of the Breath. </o:p>
		</p>
		<p class="auto-style86">
		<o:p> </o:p>
		Even in these days of rampant evil,
		<o:p>their remnant is clothed in the peace that passes understanding. Sons of Man, 
		they are enabled to formulate thoughts and words that 
	invoke the powerful and productive inner calm of Matthew, Chapter 8; for 
	they have 
	undertaken instruction by God's soundless voice as it resonates within 
	the chambers of their hearts, the bowls of their souls, and they can no longer easily speak amiss; 
		for 
	they have been opened unto the reality of the Kingdom of Elohim within their own souls.</o:p></p>
