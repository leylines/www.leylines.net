      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Two cords support life in the physical body:
      the silver (understanding) and the golden (wisdom). The silver
      serves the temporal <I>nepesh</I>/soul. The golden serves the
      celestial body that is in the process of development, the <I>ayesh</I>/soul-atom.
      The silver is Spirit. The golden is Fire. Those born of the Spirit
      baptism can measure the silver cord. Those born of the Fire baptism
      can measure the golden cord.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The body, as chrysalis of the soul, inhales
      the Breath of Life to form the <I>nepesh</I> soul and exhales
      the <I>neshamah</I> soul as it moves through life's experiences.
      A third cord is forming in each of us and is woven together with
      the silver and the gold, growing in tandem with the formation
      the <I>neshamah</I>/soul. This third cord is bronze/scarlet,
      depicting knowledge gained from the lessons of life. When the
      <I>neshamah</I> is fully and properly formed, its three-strand
      cord is not easily broken.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The silver cord seats itself in the heart.
      The golden cord seats itself in the lions. Both carry messages
      to and fro along the chakras, spanning the gulf between the heavens
      and earth through the services of the brain (oven). The golden
      cord is the right-hand branch of the Tree of Life, leading to
      Wisdom by virtue of Chesed/Mercy; the silver cord is the left-hand
      branch of the Tree, leading to Understanding through the lessons
      of Din/Judgment. The bronze cord, which, uncoils from the developing
      soul, as from a turban of swaddling cloth, is the mortal journeyman
      upon the Tree's central pillar. Until the mortal turban and the
      immortal crown are one-- until the perfected should puts on immortality,
      we live and move and have our beings because we are covered by
      the skirts of HaShem.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">Four worlds, three bodies: the composite soul
      body belongs to the worlds/realms of water (<I>nepesh</I>) and
      air (<I>neshamah</I>). The <I>ayesh</I> body (angel) belongs
      to the world/realm of Fire/Light. The physical body belongs only
      to the Earth realm, but in it all four worlds are conjoined.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The emblems of the stars of the churches of
      Asia are given for the exercise of Spirit and Fire within the
      body to expedite formation of the <I>neshamah</I>, which is the
      soul component that shall, in its perfection, put on immortality.
      Knowledge, the alloy belonging to the bronze cord, fuels the
      process of growth and consummated in the birth of the Son of
      Man.</FONT></P>

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">When you are consciously in the Spirit, the
      lower bowls within the body will fill and then overflow, the
      floodwaters rising to fill bowls at higher levels, the process
      continuing until the seven stars are completely defined within
      you. You may try to anticipate the filling and to expedite the
      movements of the floodwaters, but this is not the way. Blessed
      are they who wait upon Y</FONT><FONT SIZE="-2">HWH</FONT><FONT

      <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The upright triangle pertains to the Shekinah
      of Father and Mother, and the inverted triangle pertains to Children
      of Elohim. Beckoning to each of us from beyond Kether, Y</FONT><FONT
       SIZE="-2">HWH</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"> awaits the marriage of
      Bride and Groom. As their union is acknowledged, the soul is
      ready to grow into congruence with the full measurement of the
      triangle pertaining to the Bridegroom, the true measurement of
      the Shekinah. The triangle/<I>dalet</I> of the Shekinah/Door
      is an expedient focus. The human door/heart is not because of
      the cacophony of incarnation.</FONT>
