		<p class="auto-style94"><span class="auto-style100">The street before him was covered with roses, lilies, flowers of 
				every sort. Not many could see these quiet messengers of the 
				Lotus: their hues held closely to the clear radiance of light, 
				itself. But even those who could not see their loveliness might 
				admit that the sky was particularly bright this morning-- as 
				though the light slowed upon its destinations, hanging in the 
				air like spring water frozen in tiny jars of flawless glass. 
				Each step of his seemed to break the spell, sending silver 
				slivers of ice light skittering along from around the soles of 
				his feet to bruise the petals of the flowers, filling the air 
				with precious aromas.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">And yet, it was quite an ordinary street. This block resembled a 
				boulevard; the next, an alleyway. Shops and empty tin cans, 
				awnings and lean-tos-- the passably ornate and the incidentally 
				shabby blending agreeably, unless one should be rude enough to 
				inspect the scene more closely than it deserved.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">
		<img class="auto-style130" height="304" src="p.delphia.1.gif" style="float: right" width="192">He let the Spirit fill him to overflowing, that in its overflow 
				he might become One according to its wisdom. Taller, he grew 
				with each step; and smaller, also. A bend along the way brought 
				him face to face with the morning sun, and his hands became as 
				gloves; his feet, as shoes. His face had become as a window in a 
				vast cloud of Spirit that filled the horizon as he walked, and 
				from its happy opening shone forth the Light that exceeds all 
				radiance. As he celebrated the presence of that Light within him 
				in his walk, the force of his footfalls united the cells in his 
				body with the meanings of the day.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">He came upon a vendor in the way and felt suddenly tired. 
				Knowing the fatigue was not his own, he stopped beside the man 
				and bought a cake for his breakfast. When the peddler returned 
				his change, he thanked him for being considerate enough to 
				supply him with his breakfast so early in the morning.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
				<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">As he busied himself with preparing the cake to his liking, he 
				could see that his host's spirits had risen considerably 
				already, and that a further supportive word would not be without 
				effect. As he prepared to take his leave, therefore, he remarked 
				that sleep is death to a sluggard; but to an industrious man, it 
				is health. The vendor smiled, and the monk reminded him that 
				honest smiles are rest to all men.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">He finished his breakfast cake not far along the road and began 
				to feel some nausea. "It would be foolish," he thought, "to 
				charge a vendor with so ready a smile with incompetence or fraud 
				in baking!" Deciding the cause of his discomfort must lie 
				elsewhere, the monk's attention fixed itself on a cantankerous 
				old fellow waiting impatiently along the edge of the road.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
				<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">The man was clearly upset. He was fussing back and forth along a 
				treadmill of his own making and was muttering incoherently of 
				matters having no apparent connection. He would stop abruptly 
				and raise his arms, fitfully, in a gesture apparently meaning, 
				"Why me?" The monk noticed that the man's arms never came above 
				his waist.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">Although the cause of this discomfort was not apparent to the 
				monk, he reasoned that it would help but little to know. The man 
				was no stranger to this mood, it was clear; and knowing the 
				particulars of this appearance would only muddle perception of 
				the whole. The man was bound by an incapacity for forgiveness of 
				faults and failures-- whether real or imagined-- to which he had 
				been subjected by his fellows over the years. If he was no 
		longer able 
				to forgive, after not being forgiven for so long, the monk reasoned, the man might profit from being forgiven for nothing! 
		Why not? It would cost him nothing. He would give the man a seed of 
				forgiveness! If the man could receive it, he would begin to 
				mend.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">As the monk approached this aura of grumps and snaps and snarls 
				in his resolve for good, the angry man belched, looking somewhat 
				bewildered. Immediately, the monk's own stomach felt better, and 
				he rejoiced in the knowledge that the man was not beyond cure.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
				<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">"Good morning to you, sir! I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting 
				so long! Forgive me if I should not be here tomorrow, at this 
				time. There are so many hours in the day, you know; and every 
				one of them must be filled with something. Remember me to your 
				family; and good day to you, sir!" As he passed on by, it was as 
				though a pack of wolves was at his heels; but the monk was 
				content-- their fangs would clench harmlessly in the air of 
				wonder.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">As the monk neared his destination, the wind brought to his 
				hearing sounds of pleasant laughter. He thought to pass on by-- 
				his friends were waiting just beyond, in the place where three 
				roads meet; but he realized that every perception given to him 
				in his journey was a part of his path, and that he would as 
				foolishly ignore the apparently careless as those clearly in 
				need of help.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">Deciding to heed this call also, he found that the laughter came 
				from a group of children playing a game of marbles in the middle 
				of the road. They were kneeling around a circle they had drawn 
				in the dust and were very absorbed with the positions of the 
				marbles within the circle. If he had not decided to stop, he 
				might easily have fallen over them.</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">"What a wonderful game you're having," he exclaimed! "My heart 
				is truly blessed by your laughter. So many children, nowadays, 
				take themselves so seriously! No doubt, it is because of the 
				gravity of old-timers like me! I want to thank you for enriching 
				my life by your joy. But my thanks will not come for nothing! 
				Tell me, if you will, the secret of your game."</span><br class="auto-style100" />
		<br class="auto-style100" /><span class="auto-style100">The children giggled somewhat at such a speech, but they were 
				truly pleased by his care of them. A furtive silence passed 
				quickly around their circle and seemed to settle on the smallest 
				of them. The child got up from off his knees and dusted off his 
				trousers. Squinting up at the monk, he answered, "No one wins."<span class="auto-style71"><span class="auto-style89"><em><br><table class="auto-style107" dir="ltr" style="width: 750px; height: 150px">
